## Instances

There are two sets of Jenkins instances, SDS and CFT, both have a sandbox instance and a production one.

**SDS:**

- [sds-sandbox-build.platform.hmcts.net](https://sds-sandbox-build.platform.hmcts.net)
- [sds-build.platform.hmcts.net](https://sds-build.platform.hmcts.net)

**CFT:**

- [sandbox-build.platform.hmcts.net](https://sandbox-build.platform.hmcts.net)
- [build.platform.hmcts.net](https://build.platform.hmcts.net)

## Monitoring

- [CFT Jenkins dashboard](https://ebe20728.live.dynatrace.com/#dashboard;id=4a6a6184-f1b6-486f-b810-3b93ef05e5b2;gf=all;gtf=-2h)

## Jenkins patching

The container image is built from [cnp-jenkins-docker](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-docker).

Renovate creates pull requests to update plugins and Dependabot creates pull requests to update the Jenkins controller version.

Currently promotion of the Jenkins image is done by manually updating the tag in flux.

There's documentation for [Promoting a new Jenkins image](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-docker#promoting-a-new-jenkins-image) in the cnp-jenkins-docker repository.

## Configuration

All instances are 100% managed as code, you should never have to edit any configuration manually.

It's configured with the [Configuration as Code plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/) using the integration configured in the [official helm chart](https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/jenkins).

Configuration is in the Jenkins base for the corresponding flux repository.
