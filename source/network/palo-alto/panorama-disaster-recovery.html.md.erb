This guide outlines disaster recovery procedures for Panorama, including backup and restore processes.

## Backup Procedures

The Panorama's infrastructure and most of the configuration are stored as code in the `hub-panorama-terraform` repository. To 
ensure that full configuration is backed up, there is 
[hub-panorama-config-backup](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=1099) pipeline 
that runs weekly. That pipeline stores Panorama's configuration in `configuration-backup` container of a storage 
account in the Panorama's resource group.

### Configuration Backup

Weekly backup of Panorama running configuration is performed automatically.

## Recovery Procedures

After restoreing the infrastructure and the Panorama instance itself, the full configuration can be restored from the backup.

### Restoring Configuration

1. Access the `configuration-backup` container in the storage account from Panorama's resource group.
2. Download the latest backup file.
3. Restore the configuration using the Panorama web interface or CLI.
