> ⚠️ **Note:** We now use a GitHub App to authenticate Flux with GitHub instead of SSH deploy keys.
For more information see [Flux GitHub App Authentication](flux-github-app-auth.html).

## Creating deploy keys

Deploy keys are created by generating an SSH key locally like you would for your own account.

You then go to your repo settings and find `Deploy keys`. Click `Add deploy key` and paste in the contents of the SSH public key you've created.

Give the deploy key a sensible name and save.

This SSH key can now be used to authenticate to this GitHub repo. By default, it has read-only access. 

You should only require read/write access when flux needs to write back to GitHub. This would only be required on our PTL cluster as it has the image automation controller configured on it.

See [flux image automation](flux-image-automation.html) for more information.

## Saving deploy keys in Key Vault

You can follow [these instructions](./flux-key-vault-creds.html) to store the SSH deploy keys in Key Vault.
