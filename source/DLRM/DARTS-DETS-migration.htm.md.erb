DARTs currently stored ~680TiB of Data and needs to be migrated to Azure. In order to not impact current live services separate migration infrastructure has been provisioned.

## DLRM Migration Express Route Circuit

A new DLRM Migration specific express route circuit has been deployed and connected to separate MyCloudGateway Fortigate firewalls in their Swindon DC.

The new circuit is connected to the DLRM Migration VNET in Azure and in turn the production Virtual WAN and Hub.

This circuit is provisioned via Terraform in the [azure-platform-virtualwan](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-virtualwan/blob/master/environments/prod/prod.tfvars) repository.

The connectivity to the source dataset in the Vodafone DC will be unencrypted in transit, because of this an [IPSeC VPN has been layered on top of the Express Route circuit](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-virtualwan/blob/master/environments/prod/prod.tfvars#L264-L267).

## DARTS Migration Infrastructure

PlatOps have supported the DARTS team in provisioning the following Azure infrastructure:

- 5 Migration VMs
- Migration Storage Account
- Migration VNET
- Migration PostgreSQL Flexible instance
- Several supporting assessment/oracle/mongo VMs

PlatOps are responsible for the configuration of a [DARTS specific Palo Alto IaaS Firewall](https://github.com/hmcts/darts-shared-infrastructure/blob/master/firewall.tf), this performs a number of activities but mainly:

- Restricts traffic to/from the DARTS Migration VMs to VF DC
- Performs NATs to allow the DARTS Migration VMs to access the Centera cluster in the Vodafone DC

All the DARTs Migration Infrastructure is deployed from the [darts-shared-infrastructure](https://github.com/hmcts/darts-shared-infrastructure) repository.
