This document covers a high level patching example for the KEDA app patching. Please see [Patching AKS Apps - Traefik](patching-aks-apps.html) for a lower level example with more information.

KEDA is patched globally, rather than starting in sbox and working up through the environments, due to its limited use. There should be PRs raised by renovate for both SDS and CFT

KEDA is used to auto scale pods on a cluster. A couple of examples of this are:

- Azure DevOps agent pods: we use a KEDA scaled job to monitor for new pipeline builds in Azure DevOps and create a pod on the PTL or PTLSBOX clusters to run the pipeline.
- Jenkins webhook agent: we use a KEDA scaled job to poll Azure Service Bus for new messages when an event is triggered from a repo in GitHub. A pod is then scheduled to process the message and send it to Jenkins to kick off a build.

## Patching

Review [KEDA Releases](https://github.com/kedacore/charts/releases) page to check for breaking changes.

###SDS
Create a PR in sds-flux-config to patch KEDA in SDS.

[Example PR](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/pull/3572)

###CFT
Create a PR in cnp-flux-config to patch KEDA in CFT.

[Example PR](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/25236)

### Checks

To make sure KEDA scaledjobs are working, connect to the PTL and PTLSBOX clusters.

Check that the helm releases for `azure-devops-agent` in the `azure-devops` namespace and `jenkins-webhook-relay` in the `jenkins` namespace have successfully upgraded.

The scaled jobs created by these helm releases are the most heavily used in the project as they are responsible for running our self hosted azure devops agents and for sending webhook events to Jenkins to trigger builds.

If these are not working, they will cause many issues for application teams and result in BAU tickets being submitted.

Get the list of scaled jobs in these namespaces using `kubectl get scaledjob -n <NAMESPACE`.

Describe the scaled job by running `kubectl describe scaledjob <SCALED JOB NAME`.

You should see events saying new jobs were created with the reason `KEDAJobsCreated`.

You should also see new pods being created in the namespaces. They will be named after the job e.g. if the scaled job is called `azure-devops-agent-function`, the pods will be called `azure-devops-agent-function-<UNIQUE ID>`.

Some application teams may have scaledjobs but if the azure devops agent and jenkins webhook relay jobs are working, we can expect other jobs to be working also.

Keep an eye on #platops-help for any tickets that may come in from application teams using scaled jobs.
