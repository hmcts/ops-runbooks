# <%= current_page.data.title %>

We have developed a method of installing the XDR agent to Crime VM's and will replicate this method for nessus agent installs too.

We're utilising Ansible as the delivery method and have developed an Ansible Role(https://codereview.mdv.cpp.nonlive/admin/repos/automation.ansible,branches/q/filter:dev%252Ftenable-nessus-install-dtspo-25466) which will perform the installation.

The pre-existing adhoc (automation.ansible) pipelines wil be used to trigger the Ansible playbook (nessus-agent-deploy.yml),in the main Crime Jenkins instance, which can provide limited  scope via Ansibleâ€™s limit functionality. These are also limited in scope with an adhoc pipeline for each environment and a stack selection parameter. 
This enables us to follow a rollout plan through environments and safely stage our delivery with segmentation.

Folder Set up in Automation Ansible

We have the playbook called nessus-agent-deploy.yml, which is located within the sp-ansible folder. This is the playbook that will be called from the pipeline and declare the role to be used to run tasks on a host.

Undeer the sp-ansible/roles/nessus-agent-deploy folder we have a further four folders 

1) sp-ansible/roles/nessus-agent-deploy/defaults -  provides all the parameters the playbook needs to run similar to a Vars file in Terraform ie the installation URL etc.
2) sp-ansible/roles/nessus-agent-deploy/handlers - only runs when notified by other tasks, in thi case after the agent is newly linked to the server to restart the agent.
3) sp-ansible/roles/nessus-agent-deploy/meta - declares the minimum Ansible version required to run the playbook, and the dependencies for the role similiar to init file in Terraform.
4) sp-ansible/roles/nessus-agent-deploy/tasks/main.yml - tasks are to be run by the role ie install and clean up installer.
4a)sp-ansible/roles/nessus-agent-deploy/tasks/cleanup-nessus.yml - cleanup of the installer after the agent has been installed.
4b)sp-ansible/roles/nessus-agent-deploy/tasks/install-nessus.yml - install the nessus agent and link to the nessus server.

The installation of the agent package is declared in the defaults/main.yml file, which is the default location for Ansible to look for variables. The installation URL willl point to a different versions of the agent for RHEL or Ubuntu within Artifactory, in the MDV (non-live) or MPD (live) and Jenkins will then be able to access the installer during th pipeline run.


The recommended method is to use the ANSIBLE_EXTRA_VARS parameter, as it's easier to provide via the pipeline parameter compared to updating the automation.ansible group/host vars.

The above example is for non-live (nle) and live (lv) will be the parameter to identify which scanner server to connect the VM agent too, based on the env tags on the Crime VM's.
Further information about the set for CNP is on the following link(https://codereview.mdv.cpp.nonlive/admin/repos/automation.ansible,branches/q/filter:dev%252Ftenable-nessus-install-dtspo-254660), the new Crime set is to mirror the CNP set up.
