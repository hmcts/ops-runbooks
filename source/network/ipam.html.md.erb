## VNet peering issue due to address space clash

This is in relation to a VNet peering issue due to address space clash and the user needed new available address space.  See ticket for more informatio:

https://tools.hmcts.net/jira/browse/DTSPO-9414

### Check address space range

Check the existing address space in use by checking the address space within virtual network in Azure portal.  For example /28 for vh-wowza-dev (10.50.10.32/28)


### ipam for available address spaces

We can use ipam (https://ipam.hmcts.net/) to find next available space which is not overlapping with existing vnet space.

There are two ways we can query this to ipam APIs , using shell command or using 

#### Using shell commands

Step 1 - Get the next available vnet space

Replace `env`  to either `sbox` , `nonprod` or `prod` depending which environment you trying to create vnet for.

  ```bash

    env="sbox"

    bearer_token=$(az account get-access-token --resource=api://3fa0259b-86c8-4cd7-bd2a-e5ab28625fe7 --query accessToken --output tsv)
  json_body='{
    "space": "'"$env"'",
    "blocks": [
      "'"$env"'_10"
    ],
    "size": 22,
    "reverse_search": false,
    "smallest_cidr": false
  }'
  url="https://ipam.hmcts.net/api/tools/nextAvailableVNet"

  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $bearer_token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$json_body" "$url"
  ```

Reserve the next available vnet space if you happy with the space you got and going to use it.

Please replace the `cidr` value with value you have got from above API call and `env`

  ```bash
  cidr="<CIDR>"
  env="sbox"

  bearer_token=$(az account get-access-token --resource=api://3fa0259b-86c8-4cd7-bd2a-e5ab28625fe7 --query accessToken --output tsv)
  json_body='{
      "cidr": "'"$cidr"'",
      "desc": "New CIDR"
  }'
  url="https://ipam.hmcts.net/api/spaces/$env/blocks/$env""_10/reservations"

  curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $bearer_token" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$json_body" "$url"
  ```

#### Using Postman

Get the Token after you logged in to the [IPAM portal](https://ipam.hmcts.net/)

On the Postman, select POST method and enter this API  https://ipam.hmcts.net/api/tools/nextAvailableVNet

And then, select Bearer Token in Authorization and paste your above copied token there.

In the Body section, select Raw and Json type. You can then copy the body data from the [IPAM API Docs](https://ipam.hmcts.net/api/docs#/tools/next_available_vnet_api_tools_nextAvailableVNet_post) and paste it in the body. Replace the values depending upon the size and in the environment you are looking to find nextAvailable VNet space.

If you are happy with the range you are getting, run the reservation command to reserve the address space.

  POST API call to `https://ipam.hmcts.net/api/spaces/sbox/blocks/sbox_10/reservations`
  
  Body of the request should be in below format.  Please replace the `cidr` value with value you have got from above API call.
  
  ```json
  {
      "cidr": "10.0.100.0/24",
      "desc" "New CIDR"
  }
  ```

### Azure DevOps Pipeline

The following Azure DevOps pipeline is run daily at 8:00 AM and can be manually run to sync the newly created VNET with ipam.
