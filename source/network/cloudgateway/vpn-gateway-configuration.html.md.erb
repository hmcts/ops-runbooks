In the Crime tenants, we have two VPN gateways that route traffic to the HMCTS Azure tenant.

There is one VPN gateway per Crime tenant and they reside in the [MDV](https://portal.azure.com/#@hmctsnonlive.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/e6b5053b-4c38-4475-a835-a025aeb3d8c7/resourceGroups/RG-MDV-IMZ-01/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VG-MDV-OLDAZURE-01/overview) and [MPD](https://portal.azure.com/#@cp.cjs.hmcts.net/resource/subscriptions/9ab65d81-930d-4cc0-a93d-367e14676bc0/resourceGroups/RG-MPD-IMZ-01/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/VG-MPD-OLDAZURE-01/overview) environments.

These gateways allow traffic to flow between the two Crime tenants and to the HMCTS tenant.

This is achieved using both site-to-site and vnet-to-vnet connections that route traffic through Cloud Gateway or directly to the HMCTS tenant.

Some more information on the gateways and their connections can be found [here](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=1843333646).

## Where is the IaC for the VPN gateways?

The code for the VPN gateways can be found in the [cpp-automation-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/cpp-automation-terraform) repository.

- [MDV](https://github.com/hmcts/cpp-automation-terraform/blob/main/environments/non-live/mdv/integration_dmz/21-gateways.tf)
- [MPD](https://github.com/hmcts/cpp-automation-terraform/blob/main/environments/live/mpd/integration_dmz/21-gateways.tf)

This repo contains the code to deploy:
