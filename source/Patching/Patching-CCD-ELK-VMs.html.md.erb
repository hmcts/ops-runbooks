The CCD ELK VMs host an ELK stack and there are a set of VMs per environment.

There is a separate SSH key for connecting to the nonprod and prod VMs. Speak to a colleague to get access to the key.

Request access to the appropriate bastion (nonprod or prod) and connect to it via SSH:

`ssh bastion-nonprod.platform.hmcts.net`

Then connect to the VMs in turn:

`ssh -p22  elkadmin@%ip address% -i .private-key`

You can append `sudo` to the below commands or switch to the root user using `sudo su -`

Check the Ubuntu version before you start:

`hostnamectl`

Update the package cache and check what packages have updates available:

```
apt-get update
apt list --upgradable
```

Upgrade the packages:
```
apt-get upgrade
```

When you get to here press enter to select the default:

```
	Configuration file '/etc/default/irqbalance'
 ==> File on system created by you or by a script.
 ==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** irqbalance (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ?
```

Reboot the VM with the `reboot` command

Leave 10 mins between each server per subscription

Check health before and after by logging into a different VM within that subscription and running:

`curl -X GET http://%ip address%:9200/_cluster/health`
