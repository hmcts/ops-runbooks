# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This document covers a high level patching example for the nodelocaldns app.

## Patching

Review [Releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/releases) page to check for breaking changes.

Please note that the nodelocaldns app is NOT deployed in SDS, so you will only need to patch it in CFT.

[Example PR for upgrading version](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/38801) in CFT.

### Checks to see if upgrade worked correctly
After above raised PR approved and merged, 
1. Check if the `node-local-dns-XXXX` pod is running in the `kube-system` namespace.
2. Describe the node-local-dns pod in the `kube-system` namespace to see if the version has been updated.

```
kubectl describe pods node-local-dns-sp449  -n kube-system

```
