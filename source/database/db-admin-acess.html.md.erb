## Determine if the DB is in a Limbo State

Check the Authentication tab for the database you are trying to connect to. If neither the `PlatOps PostgreSQL Admin` nor the `PlatOps PostgreSQL Admin SC` group is listed as **Microsoft Entra Administrators**, then the database is in a limbo state

Next, locate the **JIT group** by searching for it in the [entitlement-package](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access-packages/blob/master/entitlement-packages.yml). Look for the group under the resource_roles key.

## Gain Admin Access

1. Go to **Privileged Identity Management** in the Azure Portal and assign yourself the **Group Administrator** role.
2. Add yourself to the requestor_groups you identified earlier.
3. Request the access package via [MyAccess](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access-packages/blob/master/entitlement-packages.yml) and ensure your organization is set to **CJS Common Platform**.
