## Globalscape Deployment Details

The BAIS EFT Globalscape instance is deployed in STG and Prod across several virtual machines.
In each environment, there are two DMZ machines that act as a gateway and two EFT machines that host the EFT application itself.

## EFT Enterprise License Details

## Deployed Event Rules

Currently, PlatOps maintain a set of event rules for Probate in Production and AAT.
These rules reside in the PlatOps-Hub directory on `eftbais01_prod` and `eftbais02_prod` (the AAT rules also reside on the Prod machines).
The event rules pull files from `probate-aat` and `probate-prod` containers on the `green` storage account in `rdo-hub-sftp-prod`.
The prod rules then upload the rules to IronMountain via SFTP and the AAT rules simply keep the files on disk and delete them after a week.

## Troublteshootng

Basic connectivity can be verified by checking Server -> LocalHost -> PlatOps Hub -> Connection Profiles. Each network flow will have a connection profile with it. These have a `Test` option in each of their settings that will attempt to connect to the remote. This can use used to diagnose potential connectivity issues.

For more in-depth troubleshooting, check the Reports tab. There are a wide variety of reports EFT can generate, check for the ones starting with `Event Rules - ` for our purposes. From there, a report can be filtered by site (always `PlatOps-Hub`) and then further by the name of the event rule. Reports can be exported as HTML and provide a comprehensive overview of all attempted transfers within a specified time window.
