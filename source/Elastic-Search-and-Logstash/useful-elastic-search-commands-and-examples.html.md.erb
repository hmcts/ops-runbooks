This document provides a list of useful Elastic Search commands and examples for working with Elastic Search.

All of the commands are set out to be run from the Elastic search VMs.

## Check cluster health, stats and node information

To check the health of the cluster, use the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty"
```

To get cluster stats, use the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cluster/stats?pretty"
```

To check node information, use the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_nodes?pretty"
```

## List all indexes

To list all indexes, use the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"
```

## Get a count of cases in a specific index

To get a count of cases in a specific index, use the following command:

```
curl --silent localhost:9200/_cat/indices | awk '{print $3, $7}' | grep <index_name>
```
Replace `<index_name>` with the name of the index you want to check. For example, to get a count of cases in the civil cases index, use:

```
curl --silent localhost:9200/_cat/indices | awk '{print $3, $7}' | grep civil_cases
```

## Refresh all indexes

To refresh all indexes, use the following command:

```
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_refresh?pretty"
```

## How to check field count for an index

To check the field count for an index, use the following command:

```
curl -s -XGET localhost:9200/<index_name>/_mapping?pretty | grep type | wc -l
```

Replace `<index_name>` with the name of the index you want to check. For example, to check the field count for the civil cases index, use:

```
curl -s -XGET localhost:9200/civil_cases-000001/_mapping?pretty | grep type | wc -l
```

## How to delete an index

To delete an index, use the following command:

```
curl -X DELETE localhost:9200/<index_name>;
``` 

Replace `<index_name>` with the name of the index you want to delete. For example, to delete the civil cases index, use:

```
curl -X DELETE localhost:9200/civil_cases-000001;
```

This wont come up often and if it does its typically only during a re-index change.

## How to check the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for case types

To check the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for case types, use the following command:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" 'http://localhost:9200/.logstash_dead_letter/_count' -d '{"query": {"match_phrase": {"failed_case": "\"case_type_id\":\"<case_type_id>\""}}}'
```

Replace `<case_type_id>` with the case type ID you want to check. For example, to check the DLQ for the civil case type, use:

```
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" 'http://localhost:9200/.logstash_dead_letter/_count' -d '{"query": {"match_phrase": {"failed_case": "\"case_type_id\":\"CIVIL\""}}}'
```
## How to clear cases out of the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

To clear cases out of the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), use the following command:

```
curl -XPOST --header "content-type: application/JSON" ' http://localhost:9200/.logstash_dead_letter/_delete_by_query?conflicts=proceed&pretty' -d '{"query": {"query_string": { "query":"<case_type_id>"}}}'
```

Replace `<case_type_id>` with the case type ID you want to clear. For example, to clear the DLQ for the civil case type, use:

```
curl -XPOST --header "content-type: application/JSON" ' http://localhost:9200/.logstash_dead_letter/_delete_by_query?conflicts=proceed&pretty' -d '{"query": {"query_string": { "query":"CIVIL"}}}'
```
