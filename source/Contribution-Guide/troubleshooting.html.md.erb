Guide to resolving common problems with the Operations Guide

## RuntimeError

**Issue:** RuntimeError often occurs when images and binary files are not properly organised

**Solution:**
- Ensure all images are stored in an images subfolder
- Place all binary files in appropriate subfolders (e.g., bins, assets)

## Webpage Rendering Errors

**Issue:** Incorrect file extension can lead to webpage rendering errors

**Solution:** 

- The file name is missing html from its extension
- Use the correct file extension, example: `pagename.html.md.erb``
- Common mistake: `pagename.md.erb`` (missing 'html')

```text
Incorrect: pagename.md.erb
vs
correct: pagename.html.md.erb
```

## Escape a special character

**Issue:** Special characters can cause unexpected behavior in Markdown rendering

**Solution:**

- Add a backslash \ before the special character to escape it

```bash
Escaped underscore: \_
Escaped backtick: \`
```

## Grouped Index Headings

**Issue:** Multiple headings are shown in the index but only a single page is displayed when selected

- Review your Markdown syntax for any unintended formatting
