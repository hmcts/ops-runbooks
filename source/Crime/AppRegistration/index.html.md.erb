## Automating App Registration Secret Management

This document outlines the automated process for managing secrets for Azure AD app registrations. The automation ensures that secrets are securely created, rotated, and stored without manual intervention. It supports the DCS tenant and the Crime Non-Prod and Prod environments.

Key Features:
Automated Secret Creation: Secrets for app registrations are generated automatically using Terraform.
Secure Storage: Secrets are securely stored in Azure Key Vault and HashiCorp Vault.
Periodic Rotation: Secrets are rotated periodically to enhance security.

### How to Add a New Secret

To create a new secret, refer to the detailed steps in the [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/hmcts/cpp-terraform-azurerm-azuread/pull/613/commits/c1e54763b8ce63438422b31e7668b4c7d0305ea2).

### Secret Storage

Secrets are stored in both Azure Key Vault and HashiCorp Vault. The storage paths are as follows:

- **Key Vault Location**:

- Non-Live: `KV-MDV-CCM-0`
- Live: `KV-MPD-CCM-01`

- **HashiCorp Vault Paths**:
  - Non-Live: `secret/terraform/mdv/serviceaccounts/secret`
  - Live: `secret/terraform/mpd/serviceaccounts/secret`

More details can be found on the repo [here](https://github.com/hmcts/cpp-terraform-azurerm-azuread).


### Create Secret for existing App Registration

To create a secret for an existing app registration, reference the client_id (object ID) variable for the new secret. Below is an example configuration:

```hcl
  {
    client_id                   = "existing-app-registration-object_id"
    name                        = "new-secret-name"
    create_secret               = true
    secret_end_date_relative    = "8760h" # 1 year
    enable_rotation             = true
  }
```
### Secret Expiry

We recommend setting the secret duration to 1 year (8760h) to ensure regular rotation and enhanced security. Adjust the secret_end_date_relative value as needed, using hourly increments.
