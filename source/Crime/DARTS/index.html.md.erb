## Network Flow

![Network Flow Diagram](images/darts-connectivity.png)

Above is a network flow diagram outlining the connectivity between DARTS in Crime and DARTS in SDS.

**In summary:**

- Request sent from stagingdarts pod to outbound App Gateway.
- App Gateway forwards traffic via VPN Gateway to Cloud Gateway network.
- Request is SNAT'd by appropriate Cloud Gateway firewall rule and sent onward to VWAN within HMCTS tenant.
- Request is forwarded to the appropriate AKS App Gateway (Prod goes via Hub Palo Alto).
- AKS App Gateway sends request on to a darts-gateway pod on one of the AKS clusters in its backend pool.

## Outbound Application Gateway Configuration

There is an outbound App Gateway in each of the Crime tenants:

- [GW-MDV-IMZ-APPGW-OUT](https://portal.azure.com/#@hmctsnonlive.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/e6b5053b-4c38-4475-a835-a025aeb3d8c7/resourceGroups/RG-MDV-IMZ/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/GW-MDV-IMZ-APPGW-OUT/overview)
- [GW-MPD-IMZ-APPGW-OUT](https://portal.azure.com/#@cp.cjs.hmcts.net/resource/subscriptions/9ab65d81-930d-4cc0-a93d-367e14676bc0/resourceGroups/RG-MPD-IMZ/providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways/GW-MPD-IMZ-APPGW-OUT/overview)

## Dynatrace Monitoring

Monitoring has been configured within Dynatrace to trigger alerts when the backend pool of the outbound App Gateway becomes unhealthy.
