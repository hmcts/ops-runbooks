Examples of common errors you may face when having to work on the Palos

## Problem - Not able to connect to ansible host

### **Example error**
```bash
##[error]Terraform command 'apply' failed with exit code '1'.:  timeout - last error: dial tcp 51.137.145.88:22: i/o timeout
```

### **Troubleshooting tip**
This is most likely down to retrying steps in the pipeline.
Each run a firewall rule is added to allow the Azure DevOps agent to connect to the ansible agent and at the end of the pipeline it is removed, so when you re-run failed steps in the pipeline you are not adding that rule back in, therefore the agent is unable to connect and you get the above error.

## Problem - Ansible has failed to apply the palo configuration

This error is usually caused by the Palo's XML config not applying due to malformed xml or incorrect references to objects etc. 

### **Example error**
```
module.hub-infra.module.firewall.null_resource.ansible-runs (remote-exec): fatal: [51.11.xxx.xxx]: FAILED! => {
...
...
...
module.hub-infra.module.firewall.null_resource.ansible-runs (remote-exec):     "msg": "Failed commit: Commit failed"
module.hub-infra.module.firewall.null_resource.ansible-runs (remote-exec): }
```

### **Troubleshooting tip**

1. Follow the steps in [the connecting guide](connecting.md) and log into one of the Palos in the environment where your changes are failing to apply.

2. Once you're logged in you will see a commit button in the top right-hand side of your screen like below:
<details> 
    <summary>Commit Button</summary>
    <img alt="Commit Button" src="images/palo-commit.png" width="300" height="200">
</details>

3. A dialog box will pop up giving you the option to validate the most recent configuration, click on validate commit. 
<details> 
    <summary>Validate Button</summary>
    <img alt="Validate Button" src="images/validate-button.png" width="300" height="200">
</details>

4. This will run for a few seconds, once it's complete you'll be presented with a status page giving you a clearer idea of what the problem is.
In this case we can see that the configuration is in fact invalid. 
The errors tell us that the `log-setting` value `azure_log_analytics_out` is incorrect, after looking through the code the `azure_log_analytics_out` log setting is a nonprod setting that isn't available in Production and just removing the line fixed the issue.

5. Make your changes in the rdo-terraform-hub-dmz repository and run the [pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=226&_a=summary) again.


## Problem - debugging connectivity issues
You may come across issues with connections being dropped and need to investigate where and why its happening.

### **Troubleshooting tip**
The Palos have a built in traffic monitoring tool that could help you find the issue and tell you what the reason is for the drop.

1. Log into both of the Palo Alto's for the environment
3. Click on the monitoring tab at the top of the page
4. Start with the `( action eq deny )` filtering rule to view connections being dropped by the Palo.
5. Add any extra filters such as `(addr.src in a.a.a.a)` or `(addr.dst in b.b.b.b)` to help filter out logs you don't need to see.
6. Make sure you check both Palo Alto's as there's a load balancer in front, traffic could go to either or both.
