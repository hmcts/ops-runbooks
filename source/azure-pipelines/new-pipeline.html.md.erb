When you create a new GitHub repo with an azure pipeline, you need to do a few things in Azure DevOps for the pipeline to start working.

First, go to the [project](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build) in Azure DevOps and click `New Pipeline`.

Choose GitHub as the source for your YAML file and sign in, if prompted.

Click on `You may also select a specific connection`.

Choose the hmcts installation token.

Search for the GitHub repo and click on it.

On the next page, choose `Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file` and enter the file path of the file in the repo.

Review and save.

The pipeline should now be configured in Azure DevOps.
