Plugin versions are managed from within [cnp-jenkins-docker](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-docker).

Renovate checks plugin versions and [automatically upgrades them each morning](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-docker/blob/master/.github/renovate.json)

If an issue has arisen with a new version of a plugin and it needs to be downgraded:

* [Downgrade it](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-jenkins-docker/blob/master/jenkins/plugins.txt) in the image
* Deploy the [new image on CFT](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/blob/master/apps/jenkins/jenkins/ptl-intsvc/jenkins-controller-version.yaml) and [on SDS](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/blob/master/apps/jenkins/jenkins/jenkins-controller-version.yaml)

* Jenkins may run into issues when downgrading plugins, if this is the case:

Wipe the plugins folder
```bash
kubectl exec -it jenkins-0 -c jenkins -- rm -rf /var/jenkins_home/plugins/
```
Then restart Jenkins
```bash
kubectl delete pod jenkins-0
```

* Make the maintainers of the plugin aware of the issue
* Temporarily freeze renovate for that particular plugin (add to `ignoreDeps`)
