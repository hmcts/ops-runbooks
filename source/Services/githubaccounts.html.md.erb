## User Accounts

Personal GitHub accounts can be joined to the HMCTS organisation. This allows users to access the HMCTS repositories and contribute to the codebase.

### Joining the HMCTS organisation

Users will need to be a member of the Azure Entra ID group `DTS GitHub Access` to be able to join the HMCTS organisation.

## Changing GitHub account

Sometime users may need to change their personal GitHub account but this will fail, as they will still be connected to the Justice or HMCTS user account.

A GitHub admin will need to open the GitHub HMCTS organisation and remove the old user account from the organisation by searching for the using in the People tab.

The admin will then need to invite the user to the HMCTS organisation using their Justice/HMCTS email address.

This email will allow the user to join the HMCTS organisation with their new GitHub account.

### User Error Message

If the user gets this message when trying to join the HMCTS organisation, you will need to remove the Azure Entra ID group `DTS GitHub Access` from the user.  Wait 15 minutes and then add it back.
