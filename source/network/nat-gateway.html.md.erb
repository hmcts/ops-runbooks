## Overview

The NAT Gateway is a managed Azure service that provides outbound internet connectivity for resources in our virtual
networks. It has been implemented to centralize and improve the management of egress traffic that was previously
handled directly by our Palo Alto firewall VMs.

## Architecture

![NAT Gateway Infrastructure Diagram](images/nat_gateway.png)

- **NAT Gateway** deployed with zone redundancy for high availability
- Public IP addresses attached to the NAT Gateway
- Palo Alto firewalls route traffic through the NAT Gateway for internet egress
- Centralized outbound connectivity management

## Configuration Details

### Public IP Addresses

The NAT Gateway is configured with the following public IP addresses (Production environment):

- `hmcts-hub-prod-int-palo-inet-out-pip-0`
- `hmcts-hub-prod-int-palo-inet-out-pip-1`

These IPs were previously assigned to the individual Palo Alto firewall VMs.

### Routing Configuration

- **Subnet**: `hub-transit-public` subnet routes traffic through the NAT Gateway
- **Firewall Integration**: Palo Alto firewalls maintain their security inspection role while delegating NAT functions to the gateway
- **Availability Zones**: NAT Gateway provides zone-redundant connectivity

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **SNAT Connection Count**: Monitor active outbound connections
- **SNAT Port Utilization**: Track port usage to prevent exhaustion
- **Data Processed**: Monitor bandwidth utilization
- **Packet Drop Count**: Identify potential connectivity issues
