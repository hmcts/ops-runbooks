## Re-building a cluster

<%= warning_text('Re-building a cluster is only done when absolutely necessary.') %>
When re-building a cluster, remove the given cluster from application gateway if there is a 00 and 01 setup, and then delete the cluster manually in portal. You will have to remove the lock on resource group if applied.

To re-build the cluster you need to run the pipeline in a given environment, and for the given cluster you deleted:

- [CFT Pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=766)
- [SDS Pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=482)

Click on **Run pipeline** (blue button) in top right of Azure DevOps. Ensure that Action is set to Apply, Cluster is set to whichever one you want to build and that the environment is selected from the drop down menu. 

Click on **Run** to start the pipeline.

## Common Steps

### Before deployment of a cluster

- Merge PR to remove a cluster from AGW

#### After deployment of a cluster

- Add the cluster back into AGW once you have confirmed deployment has been successful. [PR example here](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-terraform/pull/595).

## Environment Specific

### Dev/Preview, AAT/Staging

- Change Jenkins to use the other cluster that is not going to be rebuilt
  - [SDS example](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/pull/2637)
  - [CFT example](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/7138)
- If the configuration doesn't update after your pull request has been merged, you can change it manually in the [Jenkins Configuration](https://build.platform.hmcts.net/configure)

#### After deployment of a cluster

- Change Jenkins to use the other cluster, e.g. [cnp-flux-config#19886](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/19886/files) .
  - If not updated, you can change manually providing PR has been approved and merged [View Jenkins Configuration](https://build.platform.hmcts.net/configure)
- Swap external DNS active cluster, e.g. [cnp-flux-config#19889](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/19889) 
- Create a test PR, normally we just make a README change to [rpe-pdf-service](https://github.com/hmcts/rpe-pdf-service) . [example PR](https://github.com/hmcts/rpe-pdf-service/pull/318)
  - Check this PR in Jenkins has successfully ran through stage [AKS deploy - preview](https://build.platform.hmcts.net/job/HMCTS_Platform/job/rpe-pdf-service/view/change-requests/job/PR-318/)
- Update the charts for jobs and steps pointing to the new preview [cnp-azuredevops-pipelines#127](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-azuredevops-libraries/pull/127/files)
- Send across the comms on #cloud-native-announce channel regarding the swap over to the new preview cluster, see below example annoucenment:-

Hi all, Preview cluster has been swapped cft-preview-00-aks.
Login using:

```command
az aks get-credentials --resource-group cft-preview-00-rg --name cft-preview-00-aks --subscription DCD-CFTAPPS-DEV --overwrite
```

* Delete all ingress on the old cluster to ensure external-dns deletes its existing records:

```command
kubectl delete ingress --all-namespaces -l '!helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/name,app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm'
```

* Delete any orphan A records that external-dns might have missed:

_Replace X.X.X.X with the loadbalancer IP (kubernetes-internal) of the cluster you want to cleanup_

Private DNS

```command
az network private-dns record-set a list --zone-name service.core-compute-preview.internal -g core-infra-intsvc-rg --subscription DTS-CFTPTL-INTSVC --query "[?aRecords[0].ipv4Address=='X.X.X.X'].[name]" -o tsv | xargs -I {} -n 1 -P 8 az network private-dns record-set a delete --zone-name service.core-compute-preview.internal -g core-infra-intsvc-rg --subscription DTS-CFTPTL-INTSVC --yes --name {}
az network private-dns record-set a list --zone-name preview.platform.hmcts.net -g core-infra-intsvc-rg --subscription DTS-CFTPTL-INTSVC --query "[?aRecords[0].ipv4Address=='X.X.X.X'].[name]" -o tsv | xargs -I {} -n 1 -P 8 az network private-dns record-set a delete --zone-name preview.platform.hmcts.net -g core-infra-intsvc-rg --subscription DTS-CFTPTL-INTSVC --yes --name {}
```

Deletes any txt records pointing to inactive:

```bash
# Private DNS
az network private-dns record-set txt list --zone-name preview.platform.hmcts.net -g core-infra-intsvc-rg --subscription DTS-CFTPTL-INTSVC --query "[?contains(txtRecords[0].value[0], 'inactive')].[name]" -o tsv | xargs -I {} -n 1 -P 8 az network private-dns record-set txt delete --zone-name preview.platform.hmcts.net -g core-infra-intsvc-rg --subscription DTS-CFTPTL-INTSVC --yes --name {}
# Public DNS
az network dns record-set txt list --zone-name preview.platform.hmcts.net -g reformmgmtrg --subscription Reform-CFT-Mgmt --query "[?contains(txtRecords[0].value[0], 'inactive')].[name]" -o tsv | xargs -I {} -n 1 -P 8 az network dns record-set txt delete --zone-name preview.platform.hmcts.net -g reformmgmtrg --subscription Reform-CFT-Mgmt --yes --name {}
```

Once swap over is fully complete then delete the old cluster:

* Comment out the inactive preview cluster. [Example PR](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-cft-deploy/pull/485). Once PR has been approved and merged run [this pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=766)

### Perftest

### Before deployment of a cluster

- Confirm that the environment is not being used with Nickin Sitaram before starting. 
- Use slack channel pertest-cluster for communication.
- Scale the number of active nodes, increase by 5 nodes if removing a custer. 
  Reason for this CCD and IDAM will auto-scale the number of running pods when a cluster is taken out of service for a upgrade.

### After deployment of a cluster

- Check all pods are deployed and running. Compare with pods status reference taken pre-deployment

## Known issues

### Neuvector

1. `admission webhook "neuvector-validating-admission-webhook.neuvector.svc" denied the request:`, these alerts can be seen on `aks-neuvector-<env>` slack channels
   - This happens when neuvector is broken. 
   - Check events and status of neuvector helm release. 
   - Delete Neuvector Helm release to see if it comes back fine.
2. Neuvector fails to install.
   - Check if all enforcers come up in time, they could fail to come if nodes are full.
   - If they keep failing with race conditions, it could be due to backups being corrupt.
   - Usually `policy.backup` and `admission_control.backup` are the ones you need to delete from Azure file share if they are corrupt.

### Dynatrace oneagent pods not deployed or failing to start

**NOTE:** The issue described here need to be validated if still applies when the updated [Dynatrace Operator](https://tools.hmcts.net/jira/browse/DTSPO-6187) is rolled out.

For a rebuild or newly deployed cluster, Dynatrace oneagent pods are either not deployed by Flux or where deployed, fails with a `CrashLoopBackOff` status.

Dynatrace Helm Chart [requires](https://github.com/Dynatrace/helm-charts/blob/3c6ac8e9d9d62c1925e79f3fbd93e6be9af1bbea/dynatrace-oneagent-operator/chart/default/app-readme.md#additional-instructions) CRDs to be applied before installing the chart. The CRDs currently need to be manually applied as they are not part of the existing Flux config.

Run the below command on the cluster. An empty result confirms CRDs are not installed. 

`kubectl get crds | grep oneagent`

To fix, run the below command to apply CRDs to the cluster:

`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-oneagent-operator/releases/latest/download/dynatrace.com_oneagents.yaml`  

`kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-oneagent-operator/releases/latest/download/dynatrace.com_oneagentapms.yaml `

**Note**: A Flux config to apply the CRDs was previously tested ([PR14321](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/14312)) but rolled back due to issues in prod.  Change will need to be revisited with the Production AKS cluster now upgraded to v1.21.7
