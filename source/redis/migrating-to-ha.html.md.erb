## Intro

Azure Cache for Redis is a fully managed service that provides a secure and dedicated Redis cache, managed by Microsoft.
Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.
Premium SKU Redis Cache instances can be upgraded in-place to a high availability (HA) configuration to provide enhanced reliability and uptime for applications that rely on Redis.
Basic and Standard SKU Redis Cache instances can be upgraded to HA, but this requires re-creating the resource via terraform.
The redis cache instance must be in a supported Azure region in order to enable HA (UK South is a supported region).

## Enabling HA (Premium SKU only)

1. Navigate to the Redis Cache instance in the Azure portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, select "Advanced Settings".
3. Under "Zone Redundancy", tick the "Allocate zones automatically" checkbox.
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

The resource may then require a terraform import to bring the change back into terraform state.
See the [Terraform Import guide](../Terraform/terraform-import.html) for how this can be accomplished in code.

**TODO** Check if the terraform import is required, or if a terraform plan will show no changes.
**TODO** Check if the `available_zones` argument in the terraform code needs to be updated.

## Enabling HA (Standard or Basic SKU)

A Standard or Basic SKU Redis Cache instance cannot be upgraded in-place to a High Availability configuration.
In order to enable HA on an existing Standard or Basic SKU Redis Cache instance, the Redis Cache instance must be re-created via terraform.
Alternatively, the instance can be upgraded in-place to a Premium SKU and then the HA enabled with the above method.
Redis Cache instances cannot be downgraded from Premium to Standard or Basic SKUs without re-creating.

To enable HA on a Standard or Basic SKU Redis Cache instance via terraform:

1. In the terraform code, manually specify the `available_zones` argument in the `cnp-module-tedis-cache` module block.
2. Run `terraform plan` to see the changes that will be applied. This will show that the existing Redis Cache instance will be destroyed and a new one created.
3. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes. This will create a new Redis Cache instance with the specified availability zones.

Valid availability zones in UK South are 1, 2 and 3.  At least two zones must be specified to enable HA.
