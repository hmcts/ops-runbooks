## Determine if the DB is in a Limbo State

Check the Authentication tab for the database you are trying to connect to. If neither the PlatOps PostgreSQL Admin nor the PlatOps PostgreSQL Admin SC group is listed as Microsoft Entra Administrators, then the database is in a limbo state.

Next, locate the JIT group by searching for it in the [entitlement-package](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access-packages/blob/master/entitlement-packages.yml) Look for the group under the resource_roles key.

## Gain Admin Access

- Go to Privileged Identity Management in the Azure Portal and assign yourself the Group Administrator role.
- Add yourself to the requestor_groups group you identified earlier.
- Request the access package via [MyAccess](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access-packages/blob/master/entitlement-packages.yml) and ensure your org is set to CJS Common Platform
