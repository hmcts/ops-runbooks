Once TenableSC, Nessus Manager and Nessus scanners has been configured, agents can be deployed. When deploying the agents, we need the following in the configuration.

## Required Configuration Parameters

- **Nessus_server** = `<IP or FQDN of Nessus-manager>`
- **Nessus Key** = `<This will be the linking key from Nessus manager>`
- **Nessus group** = (Optional unless asked by SecOps)

We have different way of deploying agents in Crime and CNP.

## CNP

We are using VM-Bootstrap module to deploy Nessus Agents on the VMs.
[Here](link-to-vm-bootstrap-module) is the link for VM-Bootstrap module. And below is the example usage:

```hcl
module "vm-bootstrap" {
  .
  .
  .

  nessus_server = var.nessus_server
  nessus_key    = var.nessus_key
  nessus_groups = var.nessus_groups
  .
  .
  .
}
```

## Crime

In Crime, we are using Ansible playbook which runs via Jenkins to install the agents. In Jenkins, ansible adhoc job can be run with following parameters.

## Important Note

When running initially, use smallest `ANSIBLE_LIMIT` i.e. single host and verify that agent has been installed and linked to the manager.
