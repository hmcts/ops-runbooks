This run book documents the process of granting read access to production environments and the restrictions that exist on doing so.

### Pre-requisites

- The person requesting access **must** be security cleared.

- A PlatOps-Help ticket must be raised for a person to get access. Do not grant someone access just because they message you via DM.

- The person requesting the access must give a reason for why they need it.

### Checking for security clearance

You can check the ID Governance [section](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ELMAdmin/EntitlementMenuBlade/~/users/entitlementId/e7cbb8d7-bd25-4d5a-8bbc-c94c03f1c827/catalogId/ea033c19-770d-4492-bc58-d49a229df80e/catalogName/SC/entitlementName/SC%20Access) of the Azure Portal by searching for the persons name. If they are listed and the status is `Delivered`, then the person has been cleared.

When a pull request is submitted to azure-devops-ad, the pipeline will check whether the person has security clearance and post a comment on the pull request to let you know whether it should be approved or not.

If the person is not security cleared, a `Do Not Merge` label will be added as well.

### Granting access

Once you've confirmed that the person has security clearance, you can submit a PR or approve an existing PR to add them to the relevant groups.

**Do not add someone who is not security cleared to these groups**

There are groups for granting read access to production:

- DTS CFT Production Readers
- DTS SDS Production Readers

Submit a pull request in [devops-azure-ad](https://github.com/hmcts/devops-azure-ad) and add the group under the persons name in `users/prod_users.yml`
