This guide outlines disaster recovery procedures for Panorama, including backup and restore processes.

## Backup Procedures

The Panorama's infrastructure and most of the configuration are stored as code in the `hub-panorama-terraform` repository. To 
ensure that full configuration is backed up, there is 
[hub-panorama-config-backup](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=1099) pipeline 
that runs weekly. 

That pipeline stores Panorama's configuration in the `configuration-backup` container of the `panoramasboxukssa` 
(Sandbox) or `panoramaprodukssa` (Production) storage account.

This storage account is located in the same resource group 
as Panorama instance - `panorama-sbox-uks-rg` (Sandbox) or `panorama-prod-uks-rg` (Production).

### Configuration Backup

The weekly backup of Panorama running configuration is performed automatically. Data retention for the backups is set to 30 days.

## Recovery Procedures

After restoring the infrastructure and the Panorama instance itself, the full configuration can be restored from the backup.

### Restoring Configuration

1. Access the `configuration-backup` container in the `panorama<ENV>ukssa` storage account located in the `panorama-<ENV>-uks-rg`
resource group.
2. Download the latest backup file.
3. Go to the Panorama web interface and log in as admin user.
4. Navigate to `Panorama > Setup > Operations`.
5. Click on `Import named Panorama configuration snapshot`.
6. Follow the [Revert Panorama Configuration Changes](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/10-2/panorama-admin/administer-panorama/manage-panorama-and-firewall-configuration-backups/revert-panorama-configuration-changes) guide.
