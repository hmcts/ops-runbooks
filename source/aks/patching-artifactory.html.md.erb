Artifactory is utilized in the context of managing and updating software dependencies and configurations within a Kubernetes environment.

The steps below will show you how to check and update **self-hosted version** of Artifactory being used. This process involves accessing [Artifactory's website](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-release-information/artifactory-release-notes) to determine the latest version available.

Before applying the patch on the [CFT PTL cluster](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/1baf5470-1c3e-40d3-a6f7-74bfbce4b348/resourceGroups/cft-ptl-00-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/cft-ptl-00-aks/overview), testing is conducted in [CFT PTLSBOX cluster](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/1497c3d7-ab6d-4bb7-8a10-b51d03189ee3/resourceGroups/cft-ptlsbox-00-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/cft-ptlsbox-00-aks/overview). This involves raising a PR to the [Artifactory repo](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config) containing configuration files, creating `artifactory-sbox.yaml` file and editing `kustomization.yaml` files with your changes later in the documentation.

In addition, you will be verifying that the Artifactory Helm Release has accepted the latest changes and ensuring the pods are healthy and access to [Artifcatory](https://artifactory.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/ui/repos/tree/General/hmcts) is available.

If any issues arise during the update process, troubleshooting steps are provided at the bottom of this page. These steps involve identifying and resolving any errors or conflicts that may occur, such as missing namespaces or configuration discrepancies.

## Artifactory Patching Process

### 1. Updating CFT PTLSBOX

  • [Connect to CFT PTLSBOX cluster](https://hmcts.github.io/cloud-native-platform/troubleshooting/index.html#connecting-to-aks-clusters)

  • Create a new file named `artifactory-sbox.yaml` in the [artifactory directory](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/tree/master/apps/artifactory/artifactory "apps/artifactory/artifactory"), add the following and update to the latest version.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
  kind: HelmRelease
  metadata:
    name: artifactory-oss
    namespace: artifactory
  spec:
    chart:
        spec:
          chart: artifactory-oss
          version: 107.90.9 <- update to latest version
  ```

  **Note:** The layout of Artifactory versioning includes 10 at the beginning. This version would be `7.90.9`

  • Make the changes to the bottom of `kustomization.yaml` file found in [sbox-intsvc directory](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/blob/master/apps/artifactory/sbox-intsvc/base/kustomization.yaml "apps/artifactory/sbox-intsvc/base/kustomization.yaml").

  ```yaml
  ...

  patchesStrategicMerge:
    - ../../artifactory/artifactory-sbox.yaml
  ```

  • Submit your PR and ensure it gets reviewed and merged.

### 2. Check new version on CFT PTLSBOX
  
  • Run the command below and ensure the Helm Release has been accepted and is running the latest version

  ```command
  kubectl get hr -n artifactory
  ```
  
  • Run the following commands ensuring the pod is **healthy** and has applied new version. **Note** version number found at "artifactory-oss".

  • Ensure you can access [Artifacory](https://artifactory.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/ui/repos/tree/General/hmcts) website. **Note** you will need to be connected to F5 VPN to access this link.

  ```command
  kubectl get pods -n artifactory
  ```

  ```command
  kubectl describe pods -n artifactory artifactory-oss-0
  ```

  • For further confirmation, ensure that the grep command below returns the chart version that you have applied.

  ```command
  kubectl describe pods -n artifactory artifactory-oss-0 | grep chart=artifactory-107.90.9
  ```

### 3. Update CFT PTL
  
  • [Connect to PTL cluster](https://hmcts.github.io/cloud-native-platform/troubleshooting/index.html#connecting-to-aks-clusters)

  • Remove `artifactory-sbox.yaml` file and its corresponding code from `kustomization.yaml`.

  • Update the version in `artifactory.yaml` to latest version eg, (7.90.9) <- ensure `10` is in front of the version.

  ```command
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: artifactory-oss
      version: 107.90.9
  ```
  
  • Submit your PR and ensure it gets reviewed and merged.
  
  • Repeat [step 2](#2-check-new-version-on-cft-ptlsbox) for 'CFT PTL cluster' checking the Helm release is on the new version and ensuring the pods are healthy.
