When you create a postgres flexible server you can set a value for `createMode`.

This can be set to any of the following values:

- Create
- Default
- GeoRestore
- PointInTimeRestore
- Replica
- ReviveDropped
- Update

When creating a server via the portal through ClickOps, you won't get the option to set this. It will be set to `Default`.

You can set the value when using a custom template or terraform.

In terraform, the attribute is called `create_mode`.

By default, our [postgres terraform module](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-postgresql-flexible) has `create_mode` set to `Default`.

When you have an existing server and you need to upgrade the postgres version, e.g. from 15 to 16, you should change the `create_mode` value to `Upgrade`.

However, when you are creating a server, you must set the value of `create_mode` to anything except `Update`.

If you set the value to `Update` you will receive the following error:

```
performing Create: unexpected status 404 (404 Not Found) with error: ResourceNotFound
```

This is because when the `createMode` is set to `Update`, Azure expects the server to already exist.

This is documented in the [AzureRM provider docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/postgresql_flexible_server#create_mode).

If you're receiving this error in terraform, change the value for `create_mode` back to `Default`.
