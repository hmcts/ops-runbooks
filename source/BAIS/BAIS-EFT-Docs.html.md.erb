## Globalscape Deployment Details

The BAIS EFT Globalscape instance is deployed in STG and Prod across several virtual machines.
In each environment, there are two DMZ machines that act as a gateway and two EFT machines that host the EFT application itself.

## EFT Enterprise License Details

| Machine | Environment | EFT Version | License start date | Licence end date | 
|-|-|-|-|-|
| `eftbais01_prod` | Prod | 8.0.4.27 | 01-APR-2024 | 31-MAR-2025 |
| `eftbais02_prod` | Prod | 8.0.4.27 | 01-APR-2024 | 31-MAR-2025 |
| `eftbais01_stg` | Staging | 8.0.4.27 | 01-APR-2024 | 31-MAR-2025 |
| `eftbais02_stg` | Staging | 8.0.4.27 | 01-APR-2024 | 31-MAR-2025 |

The following additional modules are installed on all EFT instances:

- DMZ Multi Site Gateway
- Auditing and Reporting Module
- Advanced Workflow Module
- Advanced Security Module
- OpenPGP Module

## Deployed Event Rules

Currently, PlatOps maintain a set of event rules for Probate in Production and AAT.
These rules reside in the PlatOps-Hub directory on `eftbais01_prod` and `eftbais02_prod` (the AAT rules also reside on the Prod machines).
The event rules pull files from `probate-aat` and `probate-prod` containers on the `green` storage account in `rdo-hub-sftp-prod`.
The prod rules then upload the rules to IronMountain via SFTP and the AAT rules simply keep the files on disk and delete them after a week.

A currently unknown problem with EFT causes the event rules to fail to pull certain files from the storage account when running on both EFT nodes.
To get around this, the prod rules are currently set to run on `eftbais01_prod` only. CGI have an open support ticket with Pro2Col to investigate the issue.
More details can be found in [DTSPO-16891](https://tools.hmcts.net/jira/browse/DTSPO-16891) and [DTSPO-18322](https://tools.hmcts.net/jira/browse/DTSPO-18322).
