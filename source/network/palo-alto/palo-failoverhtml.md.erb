Reachable from behind cloud gateway

# <%= current_page.data.title %>
## Overview

For applications accessed via Cloud Gateway, we have pinned routes in place to route traffic through
a specific Palo Alto firewall, to ensure the return traffic is routed back through the same firewall.

In production, by default these pinned routes target 10.11.8.37 | [hmcts-hub-prod-int-palo-vm-1](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/0978315c-75fe-4ada-9d11-1eb5e0e0b214/resourceGroups/hmcts-hub-prod-int/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/hmcts-hub-prod-int-palo-vm-1/overview)

This means that in the event of palo-vm-1 being unavailable, either due to an incident, or scheduled maintenance, traffic from Cloud Gateway will not be able to reach the applications.

Applications affected by this are:
- DARTs
- LibraGoB
- SDP
- SDP
- Juror Digital
- CVP
- BAIS
- MI
- Interim Hosting

This document will describe the process of failing over to the other firewall in the pair. 


## Failover Process
Before starting the failover process, be aware that there may be a brief period of downtime while the failover is in progress.

Where possible, James Drew (James.Drew2@justice.gov.uk) and Kalyan Deevanapalli (kalyan.deevanapalli@hmcts.net) should be contacted in advance of the failover.

These steps will assume a Production failover, with links to example PRs for the DEMO environment.

1. There are three places across two repositories where the IP address needs to be updated:
- [aks-sds-deploy](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-sds-deploy)
- [azure-platform-virtualwan](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-virtualwan)

2. Update the IP address in the following files in the aks-sds-deploy repository:
- [prod-pinned-aks-routes](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-sds-deploy/blob/master/environments/01-network/prod-pinned-aks-routes.yaml#L3)
- [prod-pinned-appgw-routes](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-sds-deploy/blob/master/environments/01-network/prod-pinned-appgw-routes.yaml#L3)

See example PR for DEMO enviornment: [DEMO PR](https://github.com/hmcts/aks-sds-deploy/pull/662/files)
Note: the IPs are different for DEMO and PROD environments.

3. Update the IP address in the following files in the azure-platform-virtualwan repository:
- [static vnet routes](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-virtualwan/blob/b48a0cc40b52accfd6884b8811d2e79503d071be/environments/prod/prod.tfvars#L153-L156)

See example PR for DEMO enviornment: [DEMO PR](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-platform-virtualwan/pull/103/files)
Note: the IPs are different for DEMO and PROD environments.

4. Running the pipelines

There are usually two reason why you would want to failover, either due to an incident / issue with a VM, or scheduled maintenance, such as patching.

If the failover over is required to be done urgently, during an incident for example, it is recommended to run the 
[aks-sds-deploy pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=482&_a=summary) from 
your branch, as merging the PR and allowing all stages to run, the pipeline can take over 45 minutes to complete. 
If you run from your branch, and select only the required pipeline stages, it can be completed in around 10 minutes.

Ensure you still raise a PR, wait for checks to complete successfully, and then run the pipeline from your branch.

The required stages for this are:
- 'Precheck'
- 'Checking Clusters for sbox'
- '{Environment}: Genesis'
- '{Environment}: Network'

The [azure-platform-virtualwan pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=478&_a=summary) is usally quicker to run, and can be run by merging your PR, following approval.

5. Verify the failover has been successful.

To verify the failover has been successful, you can check the following:
- Your pipeline has completed successfully.
- Check the [aks-prod-appgw-route-table](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/5ca62022-6aa2-4cee-aaa7-e7536c8d566c/resourceGroups/ss-prod-network-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/routeTables/aks-prod-appgw-route-table/overview) has been updated. Check the 'Next hop IP address now reflects your PR. You can ignore any routes pointing to .36 addresses'
- Check the [aks-prod-route-table](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/5ca62022-6aa2-4cee-aaa7-e7536c8d566c/resourceGroups/ss-prod-network-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/routeTables/aks-prod-route-table/overview) for the same.
