We have a live instance of F5 (mgmt-vpn-2-vm) which before now was our only instance. Now we have a passive instance which remains turned off until we need to use it to test some changes or an upgrade, called mgmt-vpn.

It is now part of the patching rota to keep mgmt-vpn up to date with our live instance.
