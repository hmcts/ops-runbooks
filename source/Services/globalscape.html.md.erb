# Globalscape / EFT Enterprise

This readme describes a bit about the Globalscape EFT service and how you can access the two VM's running it.

## Description

The Hub GlobalScape provides SFTP / FTPS services for secure File Transfer between 3rd Parties. Some of these parties include SSCS, Probate, Reference Data and HMRC.

The solution has been built in the RDO-HUB-SFTP-PROD resource group in the HMCTS-HUB-PROD-INTSVC Azure subscription.

There is only one environment - production and it is manually configured.

## Prerequisites

* Enable JIT access to Production Bastion, you can do that [here](https://myaccess.microsoft.com/).
* Connect to [F5](https://portal.platform.hmcts.net). 

As an alternative to below you can run the `globalscape-eft.sh` file on your local machine, just download the file and run `chmod +x globalscape-eft.sh;./globalscape-eft.sh`.


## Connecting to Bastion

You need to connect to Bastion to port forward your traffic to the EFT VMs. In your shell, run the following command:

```
az ssh config --ip \*.platform.hmcts.net --file ~/.ssh/config
```

## Port forwarding via Bastion

To port forward to the EFT VM, run the following command replacing the variable with the intended IP. You can find the IP by going to either the [rdo-sftp-eft-0](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/0978315c-75fe-4ada-9d11-1eb5e0e0b214/resourceGroups/RDO-HUB-SFTP-PROD/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/rdo-sftp-eft-0/overview) or [rdo-sftp-eft-1](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/0978315c-75fe-4ada-9d11-1eb5e0e0b214/resourceGroups/RDO-HUB-SFTP-PROD/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/rdo-sftp-eft-1/overview) resource, clicking Connect > RDP > IP address (Private IP).

```
ssh -L 5555:{VM-PRIVATE-IP}:3389 bastion-prod.platform.hmcts.net
```

This will leave you connected in the bastion shell, which means you're ready to connect to the EFT VMS. You can replace `5555` here with a port of your choice on your machine if you wish.

## Connecting to the VM

For the next step you'll need some RDP software on your machine, you can use `Windows Remote Desktop` for instance. Now you need to connect to `localhost:5555`, the port opened in the previous step to forward traffic to the EFT VM. The [username](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/asset/Microsoft_Azure_KeyVault/Secret/https://rdo-ftps-kvs.vault.azure.net/secrets/admin-username) and [password](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/asset/Microsoft_Azure_KeyVault/Secret/https://rdo-ftps-kvs.vault.azure.net/secrets/sftpadmin) can be found [here](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/0978315c-75fe-4ada-9d11-1eb5e0e0b214/resourceGroups/rdo-hub-sftp-prod/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/rdo-ftps-kvs/secrets). 

## EFT Configuratiion

### Site root

The site root folder is the storage location where files are stored. It is currently using an [Azure File Share](https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/0978315c-75fe-4ada-9d11-1eb5e0e0b214/resourceGroups/rdo-hub-sftp-prod/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/rdohubsftpprod/overview) to store these files. This is configured in the EFT software.

> Changing this location on EFT will render users unable to interact with SFTP as it will remove all user and group folder permissions. 

If you do need to change the location, be aware of the previous permissions and redefine them after. This is done in VFS.

To change the location:
- stop the GlobalScape service on both nodes
- copy all files from the old share to the new
- point the site root directory to the new share then start the services again.

Make sure you have added the folder permissions back in VFS.

### VFS

This is where the file structure for the users are managed. It is where access to storage where they can upload/download files is controlled. For example, SSCS users will only have access to the `sscs` directory and nothing else.

## Testing

You can test SFTP by logging in as one of the `sscs` service accounts for example. The keys are stored in sscs-aat/prod.

```
sftp -i <sscs-key> sscs-<env>@sftp.platform.hmcts.net 
```

## Troubleshooting

In the bottom left open the Windows control panel and click `Server Manager`. You can also view logs and configuration in the `EFT Enterprise Application`. 

You can view EFT software logs such as startup by going to `C:\ProgramData\Globalscape\EFT Server Enterprise` then you can view the file `EFT-eft-0.log` for the eft-0 machine. Start by finding `Starting EFT` in the file and continue from there to look for any `ERROR` messages

You can also see logs on how files have been moved around and by whom by going to `C:\ProgramData\Globalscape\EFT Server Enterprise\Logs` and viewing the log files there.
