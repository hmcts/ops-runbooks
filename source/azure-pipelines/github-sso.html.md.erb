Azure pipelines may sometimes be required to perform an action in GitHub, for example, creating a new release as is the case with [hmcts/jenkins-packer](https://github.com/hmcts/jenkins-packer).

Because we utilise single sign on (SSO) to GitHub with our Microsoft Entra ID, personal access tokens (PATs) must be authorised with SSO.

## Why is this important?

You may come across an error in an Azure Pipeline like the following:

```
##[error]Error: Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement. You must grant your Personal Access token access to this organization.
```

If you do get this error, this means you need to authorise the PAT for use with SSO.

GitHub have an official guide on how to do this which can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

## Which account are PATs created under?

We have a central account `HMCTS Platform Operations` that we use to create PATs that will be used by multiple pipelines within the Azure DevOps
organisation, applications used by SOC team, etc.

The sign in details for this account can be found in the `rpe-prod` Azure Key Vault. You will need to find three secrets:
`github-bot-owner-username`, `github-bot-owner-password`, and `github-bot-owner-recovery-codes`.
The username is currently set as `hmcts-platform-operations`.

Once you get signed into GitHub with this account, go to `Settings` > `Developer settings` > `Personal access tokens`
and view existing PAT tokens or create a new one.

To avoid using the recovery codes, you can set up MFA on your phone.

For MFA, the secret key and account name have been saved in the keyvault as well. Look for `github-bot-owner-totp-secret`.

You can set up the MFA code on your phone on an authenticator app of your choosing.

Select the option to create the code manually in the app rather than scanning a QR code.

You should then have the codes being generated on your phone that you can use to authenticate.

If you only need this one time, it would be best to remove this from your phone again.

## How can I perform single-sign-on to GitHub with the owner account?

The github bot owner account is backed by an Entra ID account. The details for this are also in the keyvault.

Just look for `sso` in the secret name. There is a username and password.

For MFA, the secret key (github-bot-owner-sso-totp-secret) and account name github-bot-owner-sso-totp-account-name) have been saved in the keyvault as well.

You can set up the MFA code on your phone on an authenticator app of your choosing.
