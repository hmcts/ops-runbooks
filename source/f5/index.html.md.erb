## Common Issues

- Failed HDD encryption check: Likely means that FileVault is turned off if it's Mac, or some other whitelisted Full Disk encryption needs to be installed and used on a Windows/Ubuntu machine.
- User is not assigned to a role for the application: https://hmcts.github.io/onboarding/person/#person
- Failed to open tunnel, Tunnel server already launched: Find the svpn process id: `ps alx | grep svpn`, on the result process ID use the kill command: `kill -9 [the process id from the ps command]`, and or restart the machine.

If the issue persists or has no available solution, you may need to initiate a support request with F5. To do this you'll need the F5 serial number / Registration key.  To get this, you need to access the command line by SSHing into the VPN: https://portal.azure.com/#@HMCTS.NET/resource/subscriptions/ed302caf-ec27-4c64-a05e-85731c3ce90e/resourceGroups/rg-mgmt-vpn/providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/pip-vpn-mgmt/overview.

There you can run this command: `show sys license`.

The registration key will show in the output and you can then initiate the support request.

As of September 2022 the registration key is: `KVKMY-TGVEZ-FXDLU-ZBKMY-FMAYERM`
