# <%= current_page.data.title %>

If you come across a failed AKS resource or you have pushed in breaking changes that have caused failures in AKS, you may find the below guidance helpful in resolving the issues. 

If [upgrading](upgrading-aks-clusters.html) or [re-building](rebuilding-aks-clusters.html) the AKS Clusters most of the times the process will go on without any issues if the steps in the respective guides have been followed thoroughly.

The most common AKS cluster-related infrastructure issues and resolution steps have been covered in the Troubleshooting page [here](https://hmcts.github.io/ops-runbooks/aks/known-issues.html). If you come across a problem with the AKS Cluster that has not been covered in the page, please add it in, so that we have a reference to it in case the issue happens again in the future.

For common incidents with AKS resources refer to the [Common Incidents and Resolution Steps] at the bottom of this page. If you come across a problem with the AKS Cluster resources that hasn't been covered in the page, please add it in, so that we have a reference to it in case the issue happens again in the future.

In cases where the issue isn't covered in the troubleshooting guide or the resolution guidance has not helped, reach out to the rest of the members on your squad for guidance. A lot of the time someone will have some ideas on where/ what the issue is and how to fix it. If that isn't the case, the issue can be escalated to the wider community by posting in the slack channel platform-operations stating the ticket number you are working on, any error messages and what you have so far tried to resolve the issue. For any high priority problems that affect the Production environment or having an impact on multiple teams inform Karthik Chinnareddyvari and Noel Connolly so they are aware of the situation.
