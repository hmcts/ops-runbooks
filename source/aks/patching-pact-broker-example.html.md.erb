This document covers a high level patching example for the pact-broker app patching.

pact-broker is patched globally, rather than starting in sbox and working up through the environments, due to its limited use.

pact-broker is only needed to patch on CFT environment as its only setup there for ptl and ptlsbox environments.

## Patching

Review [chart-pact-broker Releases](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-pact-broker/releases) page to check for breaking changes.

There may be no new version released, in that case, check commit history to make sure the latest version released is after the last commit on the repo.

Also, check if there are pending renovate PRs which updating dependencies chart version - e.g. [postgresql](https://github.com/hmcts/chart-pact-broker/pull/42)
if there are PRs to review and merge, review them and then merge the PRs.
Release new version of the chart and use that new version of chart for pact-broker app (example below)

### CFT
Create a PR in cnp-flux-config to patch pact-broker in CFT.

[Example PR](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/29368)

### Checks to see if upgrade worked correctly
After above raised PR approved and merged, describe the pact-broker pod on ptl and ptlsbox environment and check the labels has new pact broker chart version.
e.g.
```
kubectl describe pod -n pact-broker <podname> | grep "helm.sh/chart=pact-broker"
```
