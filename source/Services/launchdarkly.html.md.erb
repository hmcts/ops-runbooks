## Introduction
LaunchDarkly is a feature management platform that helps software teams release, control, and experiment with features
in real time. It enables developers to deploy code whenever they want and use feature flags to
turn functionality on or off without redeploying, allowing for safer releases, targeted rollouts, and A/B testingâ€”all
while improving collaboration between engineering and product teams.
