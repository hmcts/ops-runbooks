thomas-test-branch This guide will help you modify and edit this website.

## Introduction

This guide will help you modify and edit the HMCTS Operations Runbooks website. The files within the **hmcts/ops-runbooks** repository are processed by **GitHub Actions** to create a static website. These actions are triggered when a merge is completed into the **main branch**.

Our Operations Runbooks serve as the single source of truth for operational procedures, troubleshooting guides, and best practices. By contributing to this documentation, you help maintain and improve our Platform Operations knowledge base.

## Benefits of Operations Runbooks Documentation

- **Knowledge Transfer**: Document your knowledge to enable task reassignment and team flexibility. Remember: If you don't document it, you own it
- **Continuous Improvement**: The second person to use a runbook often improves it, leading to iterative enhancements.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Ensure all team members have access to the most up-to-date information.
- **Onboarding Tool**: New platform team members can review and update runbooks as part of their onboarding process.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Encourage feedback and improvements from all team members.
