This document covers a high level patching example for Traefik.

Traefik should be patched per environment because it is crucial for providing network access to our applications.

It is important to understand what changes are in the version upgrade, especially if there are any breaking changes.

Usually, there will be a renovate pull request in the flux repo that will contain release notes that show you the breaking changes.

For [this example](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/27188) concerning Traefik, the latest version was 26.0.0 and our existing version was 23.1.0.

The breaking changes in the pull request were reviewed and the [traefik-helm-chart/releases](https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart/releases) page was cross checked.

This was necessary to ensure there were no ill effects from the upgrade.

For example, in v25 there was a change in the syntax for the use of "redirectTo". 

After searching GitHub for `redirectTo` we found that we were not using this feature in our configuration so there was no impact.

If you are unsure whether a breaking change will affect us or our application teams, shout out on your standup or send a message on slack to #platform-operations.

## Check existing configuration

In SDS, check traefik pods are running
```
kubectl get pods -n admin | grep traefik
```

*TODO* please revert back from below when toffee is back online
Ensure [Toffee application](https://toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net) is accessible.

Note: check [Plum application](https://plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net) for CFT.
 %>

Ensure to check that Toffee `(SDS)` and Plum `(CFT)` applications at
```cmd
   https://toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net
   https://plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net
```
 are accessible.

## Updating - start with sandbox

In order to allow patching of sbox only, a new directory was created for the updated crd URLs.

```
apps/admin/traefik-crds-upgrade-v26/kustomization.yaml
```
&

```
apps/admin/traefik-crds-upgrade-v26/kustomize.yaml
```

[See example PR containing these files](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/28837/files)

This enables us to target specific enviornments at this new crd version.

We can do this by pointing the desired cluster at this new directory via a patch in the base kustomization file.
  
Eg: `clusters/sbox/base/kustomization.yaml`

With the new crds version now available, a version selector block can be added to the [sbox 00 & 01 config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/28837/files)

Example:

```
chart:
spec:
  chart: traefik
  # update the crd version in traefik-crds when updating this
  version: 26.0.0
  sourceRef:
    kind: HelmRepository
    name: traefik
    namespace: admin
```

Update the cluster kustomization file pointing to the new crd directory created earlier.

Raise a pull request to upgrade the version.

See [Example PR](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/28837/files)

There are checks that take place when you raise a PR to validate the kustomization is valid. 

These can be found in the `tests` folder

Review the pipeline checks for errors. If there are no errors and the PR has been approved, merge the PR.

## Checks to see if upgrade worked correctly

Check the pods have come back up:

```
kubectl get pods -n admin | grep traefik
```

The uptime should be fairly recent, i.e., the pods should have been redeployed in the last few minutes.

Check pods have the correct chart version:

```
kubectl describe pod {pod-name} -n admin | grep helm.sh/chart=traefik

```

Also, you can check on the Helm release to see if it has got correct version in the log.

```
kubectl get hr -n admin
```
![](Images/patching_apps_2.png)

Review pods for any new errors:
```
kubectl logs {pod-name} -n admin -f
```

Traefik does have a UI but it's not usually exposed. 

However, you should be able to reach other applications on the cluster such as plum or toffee that rely on traefik being operational.

*TODO* please back to this from below revert when toffee is back online
Ensure [Toffee application](https://toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/) is accessible on SDS.

Check [Plum application](https://plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/) on CFT.
 %>
Please ensure to check that Toffee `(SDS)` and Plum `(CFT)` applications at
```cmd
   https://toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net
   https://plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net
```
 are accessible.

You could also delete the Toffee or Plum HRs to make sure they come back up and they are reachable via Traefik.

The example commands below are for SDS using toffee:

```
kubectl get hr -n toffee
```

```
kubectl delete hr toffee-recipe-backend -n toffee
```

```
kubectl delete hr toffee-frontend -n toffee
```

Ensure to monitor the status for the HRs and pods to ensure they come back successfully.

Repeat steps in CFT

## Non-prod environments

Now you've completed sandbox, move onto the nonprod environments.

## Prod environments

You will want to test the PTL environments on their own before upgrading prod as this cluster hosts Jenkins, Start with SDS then move onto CFT.

PR examples:

- [PTL SDS] (https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/pull/4200)
- [PTL CFT] (https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/29065)

For Prod you want to remove the previous patches you did for the other environments and just update the application yaml file see the examples below:

- [Prod SDS] (https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/pull/4201)
- [Prod CFT] (https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/29069)
