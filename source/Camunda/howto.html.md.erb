This page will contain helpful guidance on using Camunda from a PlatOps perspective

## Accessing Camunda

Camunda is only available via the [F5 VPN](https://portal.platform.hmcts.net/),  you must connect before trying to access the service on any environment.

## Local Development

There is a complete guide on building a local development environment available in the respository [readme](https://github.com/hmcts/camunda-bpm). This covers setting up your device and different development options including Docker.

## Updates

Camunda provide regular updates to the base application, each update comes with changelog and [information](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.21/update/minor/) to help complete the update.

Some updates will be a simple version [change](https://github.com/hmcts/camunda-bpm/blob/master/build.gradle#L151)
e.g. `'org.camunda.bpm:camunda-bom:7.20.3-ee'` would update to `'org.camunda.bpm:camunda-bom:7.21.0-ee'`

Others will be more complex and require additional DB Schema changes or upgrades to supporting applications such as Java or Spring Boot.

Every upgrade will have a guide that details the changes being made, the reasoning and links to guidance on making the change.
