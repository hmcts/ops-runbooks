This document covers a high level patching example for Flux.

Flux should be patched per environment because it is crucial for the operation of our clusters and deploying applications to them.

Review the renovate pull requests in the flux repos for breaking changes.

- [SDS](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+fluxcd+author%3Aapp%2Frenovate)

Cross check with the [Flux releases page](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases).

Upgrading flux includes upgrading the main flux software itself but also the various components that it deploys to perform its various functions.

You can find info about these components [here](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/).

These can be upgraded separately so it's best to use the process detailed below to keep everything in sync.

To upgrade all of these together in a single environment, you can use the Flux CLI.

The generic process can be found on the [Flux website](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/upgrade/) including information on how to install the CLI tool on your machine.

Make sure to clone the flux repos and enter them on your terminal by running `cd cnp-flux-config` or `cd sds-flux-config`.

The specific command we need to target an environment, e.g, sandbox, is:

```
flux install --export > apps/flux-system/sbox/base/gotk-components.yaml
```

This command will generate a file containing the latest versions of all the flux components.

You will also need to update the kustomization to point to this updated version instead of the existing version.

You can find a full example for SDS in [this pull request](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/29230/files).

The same process will work for CFT.

To replicate this in another environment, update the `flux install` command to point to the environment you're targeting and update the relevant kustomization file.

## Prod environment

When you get to the prod environment, you can remove all the previous changes you made per environment and update flux in the base configuration so it applies to all environments.

`flux install --export > apps/flux-system/base/gotk-components.yaml`
