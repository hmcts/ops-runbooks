## IP Geolocation Database

Used to control access to the VPN based on the physical location of the user connection. The database is updated monthly and doesn't interrupt service.

[F5 GeoIP Guide](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K11176)

## Prerequisites

1. SSH access to the F5 device, via bash. (Beware the Azure NSG rules)
2. Access to [my.f5.com](https://my.f5.com) and "HM Courts & Tribunals Service" account to download the latest GeoIP database.
3. SFTP client to upload the database to the F5 device.


## Instructions
These steps can be performed during working hours as they do not interrupt service.

### Pre-Update
1. Confirm your F5 VPN is not active before proceeding
2. Log into the F5 Web Admin portal using a web browser and note the current version BIG-IP
3. Confirm your admin user account has access to the F5 device via SSH and if any IP access restrictions are in place
4. Log into the [MyF5](https://my.f5.com) portal and download the latest GeoIP database
- Goto Resources > Downloads
- Set `GROUP` as `BIG-IP`
- Set Product Line and Product Version as per your F5 device
- Set `GEOLOCATIONUPDATES_Edge`
- Download the latest GeoIP database zip file and md5 file

### Update GeoIP database
The following steps are to be in the `*shared*` directory, which is different from the `*/usr/share*` directory, which contains the default GeoIP database files.

1. Use a SFTP client to upload the GeoIP database zip file to the F5 device
2. Place the GeoIP database zip and md5 files in the */shared/tmp* directory

- Connect to the F5 device via SSH and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir /shared/GeoIP_backup

cp -R /GeoIP/* /GeoIP_backup/

cd /shared/tmp

md5sum -c <ip-geolocationfile>.zip.md5

unzip <ip-geolocationfile>.zip

```


- This step will overwrite the update GeoIP database files, repeat for each rpm file in the zip archive

```bash
geoip_update_data -f </path/to/rpm>

geoip_lookup -f <path/to/db/files> <IP address>
```

- Remove the now redundant zip, rpm and md5 files from temp directory

```bash
rm -i </path/to/file>

```
