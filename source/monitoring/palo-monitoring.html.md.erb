The Palo Firewalls required enhanced monitoring and alerting to help manage issues pro-actively for the Platform Operations Team.

Palo Alto virtual machines generate logs both system and network that is stored in Panorama/Splunk.


### Dynatrace Access
If you require access to the Dynatrace dashboard, you will need to raise a servicenow ticket [link](https://mojcppprod.service-now.com/hmcts_it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=e8e40cb01b74b014987d1fc3b24bcba4contact)
- provide your email address (justice)
- dashboard (non-prod)
- reason for access (manage / access alerts)
- team you're in (platops)

Then contact Jonathan Forster on the dyntrace-help-admins slack channel - [link](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C03E1092B0S) and provide your ticket number, he will then advise access is provided via slack.

Use your email address to login, no password is required and this is the palo dashboard can be accessed [here](https://yrk32651.live.dynatrace.com/index.jsp?state=D3s8xiGfmKmXBw8vbEikmFeg_oC0ccrpqcLrMRaBb9M&code=547f0790-c8a5-4b2d-bb6f-eded5e6cb8d4#dashboard;id=ab163c60-07f5-7e82-40d5-35cd6a8be991;gf=all;gtf=-2h).

### Dynatrace Alerts
We have the below configured in IAC infrastructure in hub-panorama-terraform repo[here](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/tree/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts).

These events are triggered when threshold is surpassed 3 times out of 5 in the space of a 1 minute window ie CPU limit is above 90, for non-prod & prod.

- [Load Balancer Availbility](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/lb-availability.tf) - threshold for an alert is below 100%.
- [Load Balancer Health Probe](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/lb-health-probe.tf) - threshold for an alert is below 100%. 
- [Palo Alto VM Memory Utilisation](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/memory-utilisation.tf) - threshold for an alert is above 26 mb
- [Palo Alto VM CPU - Azure Metrics](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/metrics-cpu-azure.tf) - threshold for an alert is above 80.
- [Palo Alto VM CPU MGMT - SNMP Data](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/metrics-cpu-mgmt.tf) - threshold for an alert is above 80.
- [Palo Alto VM CPU- SNMP Traps Data](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/metrics-cpu.tf) - threshold for an alert is above 80.
- [Session Count ICMP](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/session-count-icmp.tf) - threshold for an alert is above 7k
- [Session Count TCP](https://github.com/hmcts/hub-panorama-terraform/blob/master/components/modules/dynatrace-alerts/session-count-tcp.tf) - threshold for an alert is above 26k

### Slack Alerts
When a threshold has been violated it will posted on the below slack channels to viewed with information about the alert to start troubleshooting.

Please note you'll need to be invited to the channel for access from a member of the Red Squad.

### Manual Alert Testing
The above metrics were tested manually on Dynatrace dashboard (non-prod - click on the top right head icon to see which dashboard you're on) prior to being committed to IAC.
You'll find the Terraform resource for new metric events [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/metric_events).

Test metrics can be found on the left side panel, Manage -> settings -> Anomaly detection -> Metric events, within the filter type palo to see prior examples. 

Please ensure that you only amend those that are not enabled (not green) e.g 1PaloAlert-snmp, to test future metrics and the following link has an example for LB [here](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-cloud-platforms/microsoft-azure-services/azure-integrations/azure-cloud-services-metrics/monitor-azure-load-balancers-builtin).

You need to set the threshold above or below the expected, i.e. CPU below 90% to trigger a problem, through using metric events outlines [here](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/platform/davis-ai/anomaly-detection/metric-events).

Dyntrace provide documentation metric key events based on incoming raw measurements of a single metric [link](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/platform/davis-ai/anomaly-detection/metric-events/metric-key-events) and this will provide the fields required in the terraform block of code.
