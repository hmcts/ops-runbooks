Microsoft documentation for managed certs are specific to each product, here's the [FrontDoor documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain-https#option-1-default-use-a-certificate-managed-by-front-door).

#### When to use Managed Certificates
If you are using one of the following services:
- Frontdoor
- CDN
- App Service

#### FrontDoor managed certificate limitations

_Other services may have these limitations too, not verified_

- [Apex domains](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-apex-domain) do not work with managed certificates, e.g. `hmcts-access.service.gov.uk`
- Domains using [afdverify](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain#map-the-temporary-afdverify-subdomain) only and not direct validation do not work

You should use [Letâ€™s encrypt certificates](letsencrypt.md) in the above scenarios.
