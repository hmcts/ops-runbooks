To add a Barracuda WAF to the Control Center:

Log in to the Barracuda Control Center and obtain the token. (You will need an account to log in to the Control Center. Please speak to Babu or AJ to create one for you. Otherwise, you can log in with the admin account. The password for the Control Center should be in the vault at "secret/terraform/mpd/wafcc_admin_password"

- Once you have the token, you can use it to add the WAF to the Control Center. [Find more details here](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/webapplicationfirewall/doc/96013142/connecting-the-barracuda-web-application-firewall-to-the-barracuda-waf-control-center)

Occasionally, the WAF may not be able to connect to the Control Center and you may get this error: "Error communicating with the WAF Control Center."

In this case, you will need to check the WAF's network configuration and ensure that it can reach the Control Center or the old server might need removing from the Control Center.
