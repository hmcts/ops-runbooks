## Check Minimum Chart Versions

This script was created to compare chart versions being used in the cluster with a minimum chart requirement.

This will be a useful tool for checking all teams have updated before rebuilding a cluster with a necessary change added to a given chart version.

### Pre-requisites

- [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).
- [`azure-cli`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Connection to one of the AKS clusters](https://hmcts.github.io/cloud-native-platform/troubleshooting/index.html#connecting-to-aks-clusters)

### Running the script

Make sure to run `az login`.

To run the script

- Clone this ([Ops Runbook](https://github.com/hmcts/ops-runbooks/blob/893fdcc51ef0ae2045e8e9488c6a54b753560c86/source/aks/bin/checkMinimumChartVersions.sh)) repository and navigate into the `aks/bin` directory
- From here you can run: `./checkMinimumChartVersions.sh` locally to start the script.
    - The script runs against your current kubectl context so you must have AKS cluster access!
    - It will generate output based on applications running in the cluster.
