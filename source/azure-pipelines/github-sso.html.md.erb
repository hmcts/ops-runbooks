Azure pipelines may sometimes be required to perform an action in GitHub, for example, creating a new release as is the case with [hmcts/jenkins-packer](https://github.com/hmcts/jenkins-packer).

Because we utilise single sign on (SSO) to GitHub with our Microsoft Entra ID, personal access tokens (PATs) must be authorised with SSO.

## Why is this important?

You may come across an error in an Azure Pipeline like the following:

```
##[error]Error: Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement. You must grant your Personal Access token access to this organization.
```

If you do get this error, this means you need to authorise the PAT for use with SSO.

GitHub have an official guide on how to do this which can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

## Which account are PATs created under?

We have a central account that we use to create PATs that will be used by multiple pipelines within the Azure DevOps organisation.

The sign in details for this account can be found in the `rpe-prod` Azure Key Vault.

Search for `github-bot-owner-sso` and you will find the relevant details.

Once you get signed into GitHub with this account, follow the linked procedure for authorising PATs and the error should be corrected.
