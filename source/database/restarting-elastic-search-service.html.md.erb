There may be cases where the Elastic Search systemd service needs to be restarted on the VM. This guide provides instructions on how to restart this service.

1) Request JIT access for non-prod or prod Bastion server depending on environment that is failing (https://myaccess.microsoft.com/)

2) Connect to F5 VPN and log in to the appropriate Bastion server e.g. `bastion-nonprod.platform.hmcts.net`

```
az ssh config --ip \*.platform.hmcts.net --file ~/.ssh/config
ssh bastion-nonprod.platform.hmcts.net
```

3) SSH into the Elastic Search node (there are generally 4 per environment)

``` 
ssh -i <logstash ssh key> elkadmin@<ip address>
```	

4) Check the status of the Elastic Search service

```
systemctl status elasticsearch
```

5) If the service is not running, start the service (requires sudo permissions)

```
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch
```

6) After a few seconds the command should return without any output. Check the status of the service again to ensure it is running

```
systemctl status elasticsearch
```

If the service fails to restart, you can investigate the logs to identify the issue. The logs can usually be found in the `/var/log/elasticsearch` directory.
