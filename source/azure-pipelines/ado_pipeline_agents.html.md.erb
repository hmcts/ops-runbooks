ADO can run pipelines on either Windows or Linux operating systems owned by HMCTS, these systems are grouped into **Agent Pools**.  It is one of these agent pool systems that connect to the resources in HMCTS Azure environments. See [ADO Networking](ado_agent_networking.html)

### Used Agent Pool
Agents maybe be assigned in the pipeline, typically called *azure-pipeline.yaml* but can be something else.  Right click on the pipeline in the ADO portal and select edit to open the configuration.
Look for the *agentPool* within the file and value will be something like *hmcts-sds-ptlsbox*. Depending on the written code, multiple agents can be described, then assigned to a specific environment.

When the pipeline runs, the agent used is displayed on the 1st tab of each stage, in the pipeline.

### Service Principal, Agent's User Account
The agent pool computer needs an account to communicate with Azure resources and a service principle is used, via the pipelines service connections. Select *Manage Service Principal* to view the details.
backendServiceArm is used within the pipelines code to assign the Service connection.

**Service Principals** are displayed in the Azure Portal as both Enterprise Applications (Service Principal) and Applications

**API Permissions**
To increase the configured permissions assigned to a service principle, edit the [Azure-Enterprise](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-enterprise) repo.
Add a additional_api_permissions property to the subscription definition in the *.tfvars file

### Example

The example below will add API permissions for Microsoft Purview to the `DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-DEV` service principal.

```terraform
DTS-SHAREDSERVICES-DEV = {
  deploy_acme = true
  additional_api_permissions = {
    "73c2949e-da2d-457a-9607-fcc665198967" = {
      "817468d0-81dd-4cb5-94ac-07ca133fbbf6" = "Scope"
    }
  }
}
```
