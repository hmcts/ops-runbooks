Artifactory is utilized in the context of managing and updating software dependencies and configurations within a Kubernetes environment.

The steps below will show you how to check and update **self-hosted version** of Artifactory being used. This process involves accessing [Artifactory's website](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-release-information/artifactory-release-notes) to determine the latest version available.

Before applying the update on PTL AKS Cluster, a testing process is initiated and is conducted on PTLSBOX AKS Cluster. This involves raising a PR to the [Artifactory repo](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config) containing configuration files, creating 'artifactory-sbox.yaml' file and editing 'kustomization.yaml' files with your changes as seen in the example PR below. In addition, checking Artifactory pods are healthy and access to [Artifcatory](https://artifactory.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/ui/repos/tree/General/hmcts) is available.
