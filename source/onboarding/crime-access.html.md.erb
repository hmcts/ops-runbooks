Instructions to request and setup Crime account access:

## Request ticket to be created for onboarding access

Send an email to the Project and Crime Delivery Manager to request non-live and live onboarding access ticket to be created using this template:

Contractor Information 

Full name / HMCTS Email: 

Project: HMCTS Platform Operations

Team:

Manager/Team Lead: 

Role: SRE

Name of Authorising Civil Servant:


Live: (Yes or No and if you have SC)

Non-Live: (Yes or No)


SSH Keys to be generated by user (needed for live or non live)
Ask the user to attach the keys to this ticket when generated. 

Is there an account that can be mirrored:
Please provide name and email address

What OS is on your device?

Are you a returning user (i.e. have you previously worked on this project for the MOJ CPP)?


## Self Service Onboarding Instructions

Once the tickets are created the user can now self service their access request following this [guide](https://hmcts.github.io/cjs-common-platform/onboarding/#onboarding) 

## Azure DevOps Access

We are moving away from Jenkins for running pipelines in Crime towards using Azure DevOps (ADO). This guide details how to get access to the CPP organisation in Azure DevOps.

### Access Requirements

To access the CPP organisation in Azure DevOps, you need to be a member of the **CPP Developer SC** group.

Adding yourself to this group allows you to self-service your access to the project in Azure DevOps.

### How to Request Access

1. **Ensure you have the SC Access Package**:
   The **CPP Developer SC** group is part of the checks in `hmcts/azure-access` that ensure a user has requested the SC access package before they can be added.
   
   If you haven't already, request the SC access package via the [Entitlement Packages](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access-packages).

2. **Join the CPP Developer SC Group**:
   Once you have the SC access package, you can request to be added to the **CPP Developer SC** group.
   This is typically done by raising a Pull Request (PR) against the [hmcts/azure-access](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access) repository to add your username to the group.
