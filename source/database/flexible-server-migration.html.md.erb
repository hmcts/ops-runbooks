## Known Issues

### ERROR: permission denied for table

Teams may encounter this error when they try to query the database (admin user) after migrating to flexible server. A new feature was added to the migration tool which now migrates roles/owners along with the schema. This results in the above error when teams are using a different admin user on flexible server than on single server.

To fix this, teams can raise a PR that triggers a script to fix ownership. Here are some useful links for this solution:

* [Example Pull Request](https://github.com/hmcts/am-org-role-mapping-service/pull/1804)
* [Inputs Used](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-postgresql-flexible/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#inputs)
* [Script](https://github.com/hmcts/terraform-module-postgresql-flexible/blob/master/set-postgres-owner.bash)

This issue can also be fixed manually by signing into the flexible server and running the below SQL. You will need to sign in using the **single server credentials** from the associated key vault.

**Note: This should be used as a last resort. Preference is to use the automated solution.**

```cmd
GRANT ${flex_server_user} TO ${single_server_user};
REASSIGN OWNED BY ${single_server_user} TO ${flexible_server_user};
REVOKE ${flexible_server_user} FROM ${single_server_user};
GRANT ${single_server_user} TO ${flexible_server_user};
```

**Note:** If the single server user is in the format `am@am-org-role-mapping-service-postgres-db-v11-aat` use `am`.
