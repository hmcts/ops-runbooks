This page should contain guides and information to help troubleshoot the Camunda BPM deployment.

## Database Performance

There are many reasons a database cant become a bottleneck for any service so we cannot document all of them here but we can document those issues that we've seen and resolved.

### Database size

We've observed that the Camunda interface can become sluggish and unresponsive, leading to service timeouts and eventual 504 responses.

Our initial solution was to increase the DB SKU, thereby allocating more resources for the service to use. However, this is a temporary fix, not a long-term solution.

Through discussions with Camunda support, we were given several queries and directions for further troubleshooting. This led us to discover that our nightly cleanup job was not removing any records from the Production database.

We found that we were storing a significant amount of historical data in the database, which should have been cleaned up on a nightly basis.

While both Camunda and the database were operating correctly with no misconfigurations or bugs, it underscored the importance of maintaining a streamlined service. The database contains a total of 16 million records, representing years of work from multiple teams across HMCTS.

The way Camunda queries the database is the root cause of the performance issues. Each query must scan, parse, and return a dataset based on the provided criteria, which means it likely scans all 16 million records before returning the desired results.

This process heavily utilizes available resources. Given the shared nature of Camunda, this leaves no resources for other users.

### Checking historical record numbers

Its possible to find the number of historical records held in the database in the Camunda UI.

- Navigate to the Camunda interface, the URL will depend on the [environment](setup.html#environments).
- When logged in you will need to access Cockpit

- From here you have many new options for using Camunda, use the menu bar to navigate to `more` and `cleanup`

     <img src="images/cleanup.png" style="height:200px;">

- The cleanup page contains 2 sections, `cleanable data` and `metrics`
- `Metrics` relates to the clean up job that runs nightly, if no records are being removed over the past 7 days then there is likely a problem

     <img src="images/cleanupMetrics.png" style="width:600px;">

- `Cleanable Data` is a list of definitions that have finished processes in the databases and how many of those are cleanable, it also shows the `History Time To Live` value for those records.
    - Cleanable data is listed in order of most finished records so the biggest possible offenders will be on the first page shown of each type

        <img src="images/differentCleanableTypes.png" style="width:300px;">

    - If `History Time To Live` for a definition is `Null` that is a **problem**, those records will never be clean up by Camunda because Camunda cannot calculate a `removal time` value. See [this](howto.html#updateremoval-time-on-a-record) guide on adding removal times to records.
    - If the `finished` count is large and the `cleanable` count is 0 that doesnt mean the records will not be removed, if there is a `History Time To Live` value set then it means that those finished records cannot be cleaned up **yet** but will be in future.

It is also possible to get a single total number of finished processes or decisions but depending on how many exist it may create a large query to the database so you should first look at the above cleanable data page to see rough numbers before doing the following steps.

Whilst we do not want to carry out any batch operations, they do provide some initial information that can be useful and they have built in query types which are helpful.

- Navigate to the menu again and `more` -> `batch operation`

    <img src="images/batchOperation.png" style="width:150px;">

- On this page you will find a number of fields, selecting `operation` will show a dropdown of available options
