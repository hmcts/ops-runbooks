# Gaining Admin Access to PostgreSQL Flex DBs in Limbo State

## Determine if the DB is in a Limbo State

1. **Check the Authentication Tab**:
   - Navigate to the Authentication tab for the DB you are trying to connect to.
   - Verify if either of the following groups is listed as **Microsoft Entra Administrators**:
     - `PlatOps PostgreSQL Admin`
     - `PlatOps PostgreSQL Admin SC`
   - If neither group is listed, the DB is in a **limbo state**.

2. **Locate the JIT Group**:
   - Search for the **JIT group** in the [entitlement-package](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access-packages/blob/master/entitlement-packages.yml)
   - Look for the group under the `resource_roles` key.

## Gain Admin Access

1. **Assign Group Administrator Role**:
   - Go to PIM (Privileged Identity Management) in the Azure Portal.
   - Assign yourself the group you requested above in the resquestor group.


2. **Request the Access Package**:
   - Request the access package via [access](https://github.com/hmcts/azure-access-packages/blob/master/entitlement-packages.yml)
