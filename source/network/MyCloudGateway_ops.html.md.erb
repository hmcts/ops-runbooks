The My Cloud Gateway service provides wide area networking between MoJ office, data centres and public cloud providers. 

## Portal
Once you have a login and have registered your mobile phone, connect to the portal via https://my.cloudgateway.co.uk/login and enter the OTP code you have just been texted.


## Firewall Rules

Select the Protect tab to see the existing firewall rule. New rules and modifications are managed via service requests.

## Routing 
My Cloud Gateway manage all routes, any routes created in Azure Virtual WAN, will have to be imported by My Cloud Gateway, via a service request.

## NAT
Network address transition is used to minimise IP routing complexity from Azure.  VIP address on MyCloudGateway enable Azure to reach MoJ offices, without knowing the full routing table.

## Monitoring
https://my.cloudgateway.co.uk/inspect/traffic-logs

The Inspect tab can be used to gain access to the live traffic logs.  Important to use filters, such as source or destination IP, as the logs are very busy.
Export logs to CSV, is more reliable than the live logs feature. Plus the file can be emailed to 3rd parties, enabling team work, on problem sloving.


## Service Requests
https://my.cloudgateway.co.uk/support/service-requests

When something has stopped working, an incident needs to be logged. To add or modify My Cloud Gateway, log a service request.

Service requests are chargable, so consider creating a single large request, if you need multiple tasks completing.
