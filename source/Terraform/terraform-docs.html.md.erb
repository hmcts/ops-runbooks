## What is terraform-docs?

`terraform-docs` is a utility to generate documentation from Terraform modules in various output formats. It automatically generates and updates documentation for your Terraform modules based on variables, outputs, resources, and other module components.

## Installation Options

There are two ways to install `terraform-docs` depending on your requirements.

### Option 1: GitHub Action (Just terraform-docs, no pre-commit configs)

You can integrate `terraform-docs` using a GitHub Action. Simply add the following workflow file to your repository at `.github/workflows/terraform-docs.yml`:

```yaml
name: Generate terraform docs
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}

      - name: Render terraform docs and push changes back to PR
        uses: terraform-docs/gh-actions@v1
        with:
          working-dir: .
          output-file: README.md
          output-method: inject
          git-push: "true"
```

Once the above workflow is added, it will automatically generate and commit documentation changes to your PR when you create or update a pull request targeting the `main` branch.

For an example implementation, see this PR: [cpp-module-terraform-azurerm-appinsights#12](https://github.com/hmcts/cpp-module-terraform-azurerm-appinsights/pull/12/files).

### Option 2: Install with pre-commit (normally non-Crime repos)

For local development, you can install `terraform-docs` along with `pre-commit` hooks:

```shell
$ brew install pre-commit terraform-docs
$ pre-commit install
```

If you add a new hook, make sure to run it against all files:

```shell
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```

This approach ensures documentation is generated before commits are made, keeping your README files up to date locally.
