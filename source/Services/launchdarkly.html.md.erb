## Introduction
LaunchDarkly is a feature management platform that helps software teams release, control, and experiment with features
in real time. It enables developers to deploy code whenever they want and use feature flags to
turn functionality on or off without redeploying, allowing for safer releases, targeted rollouts, and A/B testing—all
while improving collaboration between engineering and product teams.

At renewal, we will be required to provide a breakdown of our usage. Below are some information that will help you extract the information needed.

## Renew an expired certificate
If the certificate expires, you can generate a new one in Azure under [Enterprise Applications](https://portal.azure.com/?l=en.en-gb#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ManagedAppMenuBlade/~/Overview/objectId/e16d8b75-a799-4428-9063-e076e06b9ff2/appId/e0076553-560c-4f9a-9cd2-a4b5fdcd956f/preferredSingleSignOnMode~/null/servicePrincipalType/Application/fromNav/). Under manage, click onto Single sign-on. Within SAML certificate you'll be able to see the current certs and their expiry date. Generate a new certificate and download a copy.
Then click onto the [LaunchDarkly Admin Access Security settings](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/security), and under SSO management hit 'edit SAML configuration'. Then you can upload the new certificate.
NOTE: if the certificate expires, you'll need to open a ticket on [Support](https://support.launchdarkly.com/) and ask them to disable SSO. Then you'll be able to login with a justice.gov.uk account to complete the upload. For previous ticket reference, look up [109624](https://support.launchdarkly.com/hc/en-us/requests/109624).
