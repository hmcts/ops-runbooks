You can execute queries in any number of ways, below are some suggestions

## Small queries

* Connect to  Postgres by following commands outlined in [cnp-module-postgres](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-module-postgres#production) <br>
* Once in, you can execute provided query
  ```cmd
   psql> paste your query here;
  ```
  **Note:** The prompt would most likely be the `DB_NAME` you provided in steps you followed when connecting to the DB
* Copy the output result and send it to the authorised recipient, this is usually mentioned in the ticket. If not mentioned, then confirm with team members before sending data off  
* For small queries with large results, you could do the following to output to file
  ```cmd
  \o <filename>.csv
    <your query here>
  \q
   ```
  This should create a file called `<filename>.csv` with the output in it. <br>
  **Note:** the extension could be whatever you choose, here am using `csv` <br>
  _Example:_<br>

## Larger, lengthier queries

* Connect to Postgres as described in above step
* Create a new file, for example
  ```cmd
  vi <ticket-number>-<any-extras-labeling>.sql
  ```
  You could use `nano` as well. Just replace `vi` with `nano`
* Copy/paste query and save it
  ```cmd 
  :wq!
  ```
  If using `nano` then use it's equivalent
* Once file is saved you could run the command passing the file as input to Postgres.
  ```cmd 
  psql "sslmode=require host=${POSTGRES_HOST} dbname=${DB_NAME} user=${DB_USER}" -o DTSPO-2766-result.csv < DTSPO-2766-get-case-data.sql
  ```
  _Here `DTSPO-2766-result.csv` is where I want the results saved and `DTSPO-2766-get-case-data.sql` is the file with provided sql query_
* If no errors, you can `cat` the output file for a quick eye-balling ðŸ‘€
  ```cmd 
  cat <output-file>.csv
  ```

## Bringing query file home
You can use any `sftp` tool of your choice to connect to bastion or follow below steps

* Log out of your ssh terminal by exiting
* Copy the file from the bastion server right from your terminal
  ```cmd 
  scp user.name@hmcts.net@bastion-devops-prod.platform.hmcts.net:/home/user.name/DTSPO-2766-result.csv /Users/<location-of-choice>
  ```
  `/Users/<location-of-choice>` being a path on your file system, here is an example using a MAC
* You can now send the file(s) to authorised recipient(s) or share as instructed in the ticket.<br> 
  If unclear, confirm with team members.
  
If you run into any other issues please feel free to reach out to team members.

### Notes
In the in [cnp-module-postgres](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-module-postgres#production) documentation
```cmd
export PGPASSWORD=<result-from-earlier>
```
Assign to the variable `PGPASSWORD` the token returned from the `az account get-access-token ...` command you ran earlier <br>
_Example:_<br>
![Token to Password](images/assign-to-password-var.png)
