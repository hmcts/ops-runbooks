Examples of common errors you may face when having to work on the Palos

## Problem - Not able to connect to ansible host

### **Example error**

```bash
##[error]Terraform command 'apply' failed with exit code '1'.:  timeout - last error: dial tcp 51.137.145.88:22: i/o timeout
```

### **Troubleshooting tip**

This is most likely down to retrying steps in the pipeline.
Each run a firewall rule is added to allow the Azure DevOps agent to connect to the ansible agent and at the end of the pipeline it is removed, so when you re-run failed steps in the pipeline you are not adding that rule back in, therefore the agent is unable to connect and you get the above error.

## Problem - Ansible has failed to apply the palo configuration

This error is usually caused by the Palo's XML config not applying due to malformed xml or incorrect references to objects etc.

### **Example error**

```bash
module.hub-infra.module.firewall.null_resource.ansible-runs (remote-exec): fatal: [51.11.xxx.xxx]: FAILED! => {
...
...
...
module.hub-infra.module.firewall.null_resource.ansible-runs (remote-exec):     "msg": "Failed commit: Commit failed"
module.hub-infra.module.firewall.null_resource.ansible-runs (remote-exec): }
```

### **Troubleshooting tip**

1. Follow the steps in [the connecting guide](connecting-palos.html) and log into one of the Palos in the environment where your changes are failing to apply.

2. Once you're logged in you will see a commit button in the top right-hand side of your screen like below:

    <details>
        <summary>Commit Button</summary>
        <img alt="Commit Button" src="images/palo-commit.png" width="300" height="200">
    </details>

3. A dialog box will pop up giving you the option to validate the most recent configuration, click on validate commit.

    <details>
        <summary>Validate Button</summary>
        <img alt="Validate Button" src="images/validate-button.png" width="300" height="200">
    </details>

4. This will run for a few seconds, once it's complete you'll be presented with a status page giving you a clearer idea of what the problem is.

    In this case we can see that the configuration is in fact invalid.
    The errors tell us that the `log-setting` value `azure_log_analytics_out` is incorrect, after looking through the code the `azure_log_analytics_out` log setting is a nonprod setting that isn't available in Production and just removing the line fixed the issue.

        <summary>Validate Example</summary>
        <img alt="Validate Example" src="images/example-validate.png" width="300" height="200">
    </details>

5. Make your changes in the rdo-terraform-hub-dmz repository and run the [pipeline](https://dev.azure.com/hmcts/PlatformOperations/_build?definitionId=226&_a=summary) again.

## Problem - debugging connectivity issues

You may come across issues with connections being dropped and need to investigate where and why its happening.

### **Troubleshooting tip**

The Palos have a built in traffic monitoring tool that could help you find the issue and tell you what the reason is for the drop.

1. Log into both of the Palo Alto's for the environment
2. Click on the monitoring tab at the top of the page
3. Start with the `( action eq deny )` filtering rule to view connections being dropped by the Palo.
4. Add any extra filters such as `(addr.src in a.a.a.a)` or `(addr.dst in b.b.b.b)` to help filter out logs you don't need to see.
5. Make sure you check both Palo Alto's as there's a load balancer in front, traffic could go to either or both.

## Disk space full messages

If the management UI becomes unresponsive, there is a chance the VM has ran out of disk space and is struggling. You may
see errors in the `System` log such as `Disk usage for / exceeds limit, 100 percent in use, cleaning filesystem` the `/` means
root. Some other path may be presented in the error not always `/`.

<details>
    <summary>Disk usage for / exceeds limit</summary>
    <img alt="Disk usage" src="images/disk_usage_exceeds_limit.png" width="423">
</details>

When this happens then there needs to be a cleaning exercise or a hard reboot as a last resort.


### **Troubleshooting tip**

1. Log unto the VPN and `ssh` into the vm in questions. Good chance that at this point the management UI is inaccessible
2. Check that there aren't any disk partition maxed out
   ```cmd
   show system disk-space
   ```

   <details>
    <summary>Disk usage for / exceeds limit</summary>
    <img alt="Disk usage result" src="images/disk_usage_high.png" width="591" height="225">
   </details>

3. Verify the aggressive clean up is enabled
   ```cmd
   show system state | match aggressive-cleaning
   ```
   At the moment, setting is only available via the terminal. There is a possibility that this gets lost between major version upgrades or vm restarts
4. In above command give no output then there is need to enable it per vm. chose `y` option to remove all old file. SysLog information would have already been
   sent to Panorama log collector, run the bellow command in the terminal
   ```cmd
   debug software disk-usage aggressive-cleaning enable
   ```

   <details>
    <summary>Enable cleanup</summary>
    <img alt="Disk usage result" src="images/disk_usage_enable_cleanup.png" width="514">
   </details>

5. Set to threshold to `90%` or lower e.g. `85%`
   ```cmd
   debug software disk-usage cleanup deep threshold 90
   ```

   <details>
    <summary>Disk cleanup setting</summary>
    <img alt="Disk usage result" src="images/disk_usage_reset.png" width="775">
   </details>

   You should see info stating usage has been adjusted

6. Perform other clean up tasks described in the documentation links below
