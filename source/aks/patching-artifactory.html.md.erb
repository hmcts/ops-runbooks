Artifactory is utilized in the context of managing and updating software dependencies and configurations within a Kubernetes environment.
Here's how it is used based on the provided instructions:

The steps below will show you how to check and update **self-hosted version** of Artifactory being used. This process involves accessing [Artifactory's website](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-release-information/artifactory-release-notes) to determine the latest **self-hosted version** version available.

Before applying the update on PTL AKS Cluster, a testing process is initiated and is conducted on PTLSBOX AKS Cluster. This involves raising a PR to [GitHub](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config) containing configuration files for Artifactory, creating 'artifactory-sbox.yaml' file and editing 'kustomization.yaml' files with your changes as seen in the example PR below

If any issues arise during the update process, troubleshooting steps are provided. These steps involve identifying and resolving any errors or conflicts that may occur, such as missing namespaces or configuration discrepancies.
