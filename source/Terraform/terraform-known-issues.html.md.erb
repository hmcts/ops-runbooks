## Concurrent Federated Identity Credentials Issue

### Issue Description

When moving from the azapi resource to the new Federated Identity Credentials resource (https://github.com/hmcts/aks-module-kubernetes/blob/master/service-operator.tf), I encountered an issue with the creation of multiple Federated Identities at the same time.

When creating or deleting Federated Identity Credentials for multiple clusters concurrently, the following error occurs:

> Too many Federated Identity Credentials are written concurrently for the managed identity. Concurrent Federated Identity Credentials writes under the same managed identity are not supported.

See the example below:

This error typically occurs during the creation of multiple Federated Identities at the same time, rather than during deletion. The process should delete the `azapi` resource first and then create the new resource.

### Resolution

To fix this issue, re-run the `terraform apply` command. The process should complete successfully on the second attempt. I also checked, and there are currently no other issues raised on the Azurerm Terraform provider.

This is a known issue that was recently fixed in the following update:  

[HashiCorp Terraform Provider Azurerm Pull Request #20003](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/pull/20003)

### Workaround

**Manual Selection**: Manually selecting a single cluster for creation does not result in this error.
