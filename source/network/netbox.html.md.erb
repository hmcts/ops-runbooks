## VNet peering issue due to address space clash

This is in relation to a VNet peering issue due to address space clash and the user needed new available address space.  See ticket for more informatio:

https://tools.hmcts.net/jira/browse/DTSPO-9414

### Check address space range

Check the existing address space in use by checking the address space within virtual network in Azure portal.  For example /28 for vh-wowza-dev (10.50.10.32/28)


### Netbox for available address spaces

Open the following URL to access Netbox (make sure you are connected to the VPN):

https://netbox.platform.hmcts.net/ipam/prefixes/446/prefixes/?per_page=1000

Check for the addresses marked as available and not active for the required address range (i.e. /28)


### Run the curl commands to verify the address space is not in use

Note - this uses the jq command.  If you don't have this then run:

```bash
brew install jq
```

Run the following command to check that the address space is not in use (using 10.50.11.16/28 as an example):

```bash
➜  ~ curl -X GET -k https://netbox.platform.hmcts.net:443/api/ipam/prefixes/\?within\=10.50.11.16%2F28 -H "accept: application/json" | jq .
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100    52  100    52    0     0     11      0  0:00:04  0:00:04 --:--:--    12
{
  "count": 0,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": []
}
```

The following is an example when an address space is in use and can't be used:

```bash
➜  ~ curl -X GET -k https://netbox.platform.hmcts.net:443/api/ipam/prefixes/\?within\=10.50.0.0%2F16 -H "accept: application/json" | jq .
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 13084  100 13084    0     0  16499      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 16478
{
  "count": 17,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 82,
      "url": "http://netbox.platform.hmcts.net/api/ipam/prefixes/82/",
      "display": "10.50.10.0/28",
      "family": {
        "value": 4,
        "label": "IPv4"
      },
      ........
  ]
}
```
