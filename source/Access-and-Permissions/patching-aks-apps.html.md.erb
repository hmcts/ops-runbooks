This run book documents the process of granting read access to production environments and the restrictions that exist on doing so.

### Pre-requisites

- A PlatOps-Help ticket must be raised for a person to get access. Do not grant someone access just because they message you via DM.

- The person requesting the access must give a reason for why they need it.

- The person must be security cleared.

### Checking for security clearance

You can check the ID Governance [section](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ELMAdmin/EntitlementMenuBlade/~/users/entitlementId/e7cbb8d7-bd25-4d5a-8bbc-c94c03f1c827/catalogId/ea033c19-770d-4492-bc58-d49a229df80e/catalogName/SC/entitlementName/SC%20Access) of the Azure Portal by searching for the persons name. If they are listed and the status is `Delivered`, then the person has been cleared.
