This run book documents some tasks that we have to perform when patching apps on the AKS Clusters. This runbook will use Traefik as an example throughout. Please see bottom of this page for other app examples.

**Note: steps may differ depending on the application being patched.**


## App Patching Schedule

Patching is shared across the Platform Operations team, review the patching rota to view which app is due and who it is assigned to.

[Patching Rota](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/DTSPlatformOperations/Shared%20Documents/General/Patching%20Calendar%202024%20v1.xlsx?d=w72761ec6e128433f8b676893edd8be59&csf=1&web=1&e=2Ewqzn)

## Patching order by Environment

Typically app patching is split into 3 segments, based on environment. This is the normal order we use to apply patches:

SDS is a good place to start, as any issues will have a smaller impact due to the size of the platform.
