The current Panorama, Log Collectors and Firewall software version is curently at `11.0.4-h2`, `h` stands for Hotfix.
We aim to be as close as possible with Palo Alto software releases on both the Panorama management servers and the firewall servers.
The Panorama's must always be the same or higher software version then the Palo's.

### Current Estate
We have infrastructure in UKSouth listed below.

- 1 `sbox` Panorama servers in Panorama mode (1 in UKSouth)
- 2 `prod` Panorama servers in HA mode (2 in UKSouth)
- 1 Log collector (in UKSouth)

### Update Process

The Panorama's need to updated in the above order under current estate.

To update the Panorama servers is straight forward and there are already documented steps to 
follow in the [Upgrade Panorama with an Internet Connection](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-upgrade/upgrade-panorama/install-content-and-software-updates-for-panorama/install-updates-for-panorama-with-internet-connection) documentation.

For the prod Panorama's in HA mode please follow the [Upgrade Panorama in an HA Configuration](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-upgrade/upgrade-panorama/install-content-and-software-updates-for-panorama/install-updates-for-panorama-with-ha-configuration) guide.

### Updates via Panorama
There is an extensive guide, [Deploy Upgrades to Firewalls, Log Collectors, and WildFire Appliances Using Panorama](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-upgrade/upgrade-panorama/deploy-updates-to-firewalls-log-collectors-and-wildfire-appliances-using-panorama) with steps 
on how to use Panorama to update other resources and the [Firewalls](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/11-0/pan-os-upgrade/upgrade-panorama/deploy-updates-to-firewalls-log-collectors-and-wildfire-appliances-using-panorama/upgrade-firewalls-when-panorama-is-internet-connected).

Log in details for UKSouth Panorama management servers requires only your HMCTS account as SSO has been setup, if you need elevated privileges e.g. to reboot the vm then log in using the admin details mentioned below.

### Log Collectors
At the time of last update for the Log Collectors, this was done manually by logging on to the vms. Admin login details for each region's Panorama management server can be found in the respective `panorama-sbox-xxx-kv` or `panorama-prod-xxx-kv`  keyvault in Azure. This would be the `panorama-admin-username` and `panorama-admin-password` items.
Please follow the below steps.

- Login on to the log collector vm, you need to be on the `VPN` and via the `bastions`
- Run the follow commands in order
 
```bash
  show system info | match sw-version
  ```
 
  to get the current version
 
  ```bash
  request system software check
  ```
 
  to get available versions to install
 
  ```bash
  request system software download version <version-number>
  ```
 
  to download target version, this will output a job id
 
  ```bash
  show jobs id <job-id>
  ```
 
  to view job status
   
  ```bash
  request system software install version <version-number>
  ```
  to install target version, this returns a job id
  
  ```bash
  show jobs id <job-id>
  ```      
  to view job status
  
  ```bash
  request restart system 
  ```
  to restart the system, This will disconnect you from the SSH CLI session that you are connected to

  If you receive an error 'requires a content version of 8770 or greater and found 8770 or greater found 8762-8327', you need update prior to updating the software version.
  
  ```bash
  request content upgrade download latest
  ``` 
 
 ```bash
  request content upgrade install version latest
 ``` 

- Log back on to the Log Collector, give 5 to 7min for it to reboot  
  Run the `show system info` command as above to verify that the version has been updated
  
- Log on to the Panorama management web UI, navigate to
   `Panorama` -> `Managed Collectors` and verify that the Panorama log collector Status entries are `connected` and `In sync` and the Software Version also reflects the new version
