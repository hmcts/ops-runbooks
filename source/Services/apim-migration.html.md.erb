- stv1, or Single-tenant version 1, is an Azure-allocated compute infrastructure. It represents an older version of Azure single-tenant compute infrastructure.

- stv2, or Single-tenant version 2, is a more advanced Azure-allocated compute infrastructure. It supports additional features such as availability zones and private endpoints. This version is available for various tiers including Developer, Basic, Standard, and Premium.
This runbook describes how to upgrade the Azure API Management platform version, specifically migrating from stv1 to stv2.

Follow these steps to perform the migration:

Trigger the migration by moving to the new subnet. This can be done via the pipeline by setting the environment variable trigger_migration to true. After about 20 minutes, stv1 should be upgraded to stv2 and be in the new subnet.

Move stv2 back to the old subnet via the pipeline by setting the environment variable trigger_migration to false. After about 20 minutes, the APIM instance should be back in the old subnet.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Code clean up: Wait for 40 minutes for the temporary IP to disassociate from the Azure owned load balancer.

>>>>>>> origin/add-apim-migration
For all other environments, you will need to pass the temporary subnet prefix via the component to create the migration subnet as iaas will not be used in the migration.

Ensure the subnet of the API Management route table is the same as the temporary one.

Clean up temporary resources

Wait 40 minutes for temporary IP to disassociate from Azure owned load balancer.

<<<<<<< HEAD
After the migration, Resources clean up via triggering the temp_pip variable which will destroy all temp resources.
=======
After the migration, clean up the temporary resources from the module and do sds repo 
>>>>>>> origin/add-apim-migration

Run the pipeline to destroy the temporary resources.

Confirm the migration is successful by checking the APIM instance is in the old subnet and test the API endpoints.
