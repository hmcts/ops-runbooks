It is important to understand what changes are in the version upgrade, especially if there are any breaking changes.

For this example, the latest version in v26 and our existing version was v23.1.0

The [traefik-helm-chart/releases](https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart/releases) page was reviewed, paying particular attention to any breaking changes.

For example: in v25 there was a change in the syntax for the use of "redirectTo". After searching GitHub we found that we were not using this feature in our configuration so there was no impact.

## Test existing configuration

In SDS, check traefik pods are running
```
kubectl get pods -n admin | grep traefik
```

Ensure [toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/](https://toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/) is accessible.

Note: check [plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/](https://plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/) for CFT.

## Updating

In order to allow patching of sbox only, a new directory was created for the updated crd URLs.

```
apps/admin/traefik-crds-upgrade-v26/kustomization.yaml
```
&

```
apps/admin/traefik-crds-upgrade-v26/kustomize.yaml
```

[See example PR containing these files](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/28837/files)

This enables us to target specific enviornments at this new crd version.

We can do this by pointing the desired cluster at this new directory via a patch in the base kustomization file.
  
Eg:

![](Images/patching_apps_3.png)
```
clusters/sbox/base/kustomization.yaml
```

With the new crds version now available, a version selector block can be added to the [sbox 00 & 01 config](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/28837/files)

Example:

```
chart:
spec:
  chart: traefik
  # update the crd version in traefik-crds when updating this
  version: 26.0.0
  sourceRef:
    kind: HelmRepository
    name: traefik
    namespace: admin
```

Update the cluster kustomization file pointing to the new crd directory created earlier - see pr below

See [Example PR](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/28837/files)

Once the PR has been raised and the checks have been reviewed for errors - merge the PR.

## Checks to see if upgrade worked correctly

You can start checking the flux config to make sure it hasnâ€™t got any error and it has reconciled correctly

```
kubectl get kustomizations.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io -n flux-system
```

Review cluster pods for Traefik have come back up:
```
kubectl get pods -n admin | grep traefik
```

Check pods have the correct chart version:
```
kubectl describe pod {pod-name} -n admin | grep helm.sh/chart=traefik
```
![](Images/patching_apps_1.png)

Also, you can check on the Helm release to see if it has got correct version in the log

```
kubectl get hr -n admin
```
![](Images/patching_apps_2.png)

Review pods for any new errors:
```
kubectl logs {pod-name} -n admin -f
```

Check test sites are accessible

Ensure [toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/](https://toffee.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/) is accessible.

Note: check [plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/](https://plum.sandbox.platform.hmcts.net/) for CFT.

In sandbox, delete Toffee / Plum HRs to test
```
kubectl get hr -n toffee
```

```
kubectl delete hr toffee-recipe-backend -n toffee
```
```
kubectl delete hr toffee-frontend -n toffee
```

Ensure to monitor the status for the HRs and pods to ensure they come back successfully.

Repeat steps in CFT

## Ready to move onto Non-prod environments.

## AAD Pod Identity has been depricated hence there is not going to be further patches.

[AAD Pod Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/releases) already using latest version on both sds and CFT.

[CNP](https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/blob/04dd5c0c33a789e672021c4a9daeb83c6aad1de8/apps/admin/aad-pod-id/kustomization.yaml#L5)

[SDS](https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/blob/7d17076d3b98f6f8ec225aa55dea15c18cfc6977/apps/admin/aad-pod-identity/kustomization.yaml#L5)

## Prod environments.

You want to test ptl environment on its own before upgrading prod as this cluster hosts Jenkins, Start with SDS then move onto CFT.

[PTL SDS] (https://github.com/hmcts/sds-flux-config/pull/4200)
[PTL CFT] (https://github.com/hmcts/cnp-flux-config/pull/29065)

For Prod you want to remove the previous patches you did for the other environments and just update the application yaml file see the examples below:
