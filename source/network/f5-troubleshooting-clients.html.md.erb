## Windows 

While it is possible to install the F5 client software on Windows computers, local administrator permissions are required to complete the process.
Problems with DNS name resolution will be encountered by non-admin users.

## MacOS

Users have reported problems when using the F5 VPN if other VPNs are also installed. Such as MoJs Global Protect VPN. Turning off the unrequired VPN, will resolve the issue.
By opening a terminal on the mac and using the command 'scutil --dns' the local DNS configuration can be seen.

## DNS Resolvers

Split tunnel is used by the HMCTS F5 VPN, with IPv4 Primary (10.11.75.4) and Secondary (168.63.129.19) name servers, assigned as part of the netacl_mojvpn configuration.

F5 Admin Portal >> Access  ››  Connectivity / VPN : Network Access (VPN) : Network Access Lists  ››  netacl_mojvpn

10.11.75.4 is the Azure DNS private resolver 'private-dns-resolver-uksouth-prod-int'.  Before Azure private DNS zones or DNS zones are visible to clients, the zones vNET must be linked to mgmt-vpn-2-vnet in Azure portal.
