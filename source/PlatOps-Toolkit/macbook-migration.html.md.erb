This guide provides step-by-step instructions to migrate your development environment and configuration from your old MacBook to a new one.

## Step 1: Install Applications on New MacBook

On your **new laptop**, install necessary applications from the SelfServe portal:

1. Install core applications you use daily (examples: VS Code, Microsoft Office, Sublime Text, Firefox, Adobe Reader, iTerm2, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
2. Log in to communication and productivity apps:
   - Slack
   - Microsoft Teams
   - Outlook
   - Any other tools relevant to your work

Use your justice account for all authentication.

## Step 2: Export Homebrew Packages from Old MacBook

On your **old laptop**, export all Homebrew-installed applications:

```bash
# List all installed Homebrew packages
brew list

# Update Homebrew and create a Brewfile
brew update
brew bundle dump --file Brewfile --describe --force
```

### Verify the Export (Optional)

To confirm all packages were captured:

```bash
brew bundle list --file ~/Brewfile
```

## Step 3: Transfer Brewfile to New MacBook

Transfer the `~/Brewfile` from your old laptop to your new one using:

- OneDrive (if you are logged into both machines)
- Slack

Place the file in an accessible location (e.g., `~/Downloads/Brewfile`)

## Step 4: Import Homebrew Packages on New MacBook

On your **new laptop**, install all packages from the Brewfile:

```bash
brew update
brew bundle --file ~/Downloads/Brewfile
```

### Installing Cask Applications

For macOS-specific applications (cask installations), ensure they are installed to the `~/Applications` directory:

```bash
# Install a cask application to ~/Applications
brew install --cask --force intellij-idea --appdir=~/Applications

# Uninstall a cask application
brew uninstall --cask --force intellij-idea
```

## Step 5: Copy Shell Configuration (.zshrc)

Transfer your shell configuration file from the old MacBook:

```bash
# On old MacBook - display your zsh configuration
cat ~/.zshrc
```

Copy the output and create the same file on your new MacBook:

```bash
# On new MacBook - create or update ~/.zshrc with the content from your old machine
nano ~/.zshrc  # or use your preferred editor
```

You can transfer the file via OneDrive or Slack if preferred.

## Step 6: Copy SSH Configuration

SSH keys and configuration are essential for accessing Git repositories and VMs:

```bash
# Copy the entire ~/.ssh/ directory from old to new MacBook
# This includes private keys, public keys, and SSH config files
```

**Important**: Ensure you copy everything in the `~/.ssh/` directory to avoid SSH authentication issues when accessing Crime VMs and other infrastructure.

## Step 7: Crime Setup (If Applicable)

If you work with the Crime infrastructure, follow the setup guides on your new MacBook:

- [Crime VPN & Gerrit Access Setup](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/spaces/DATS/pages/1597739711/Crime+VPN+Gerrit+Access+Setup+In+Simple+Steps#CrimeVPN&GerritAccess&SetupInSimpleSteps-IfonMacOS)
- [MacBook Setup for AKS](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/spaces/EI/pages/1498639128/MacBook+Setup+for+AKS)

## Step 8: Crime VPN Setup - Tunnelblick

Transfer your VPN configuration:

1. **Export the VPN config from your old MacBook**
   - Export the existing Crime VPN configuration file from Tunnelblick

2. **Transfer the `.tblkSetup` file to your new MacBook**
   - Transfer the `.tblkSetup` file to your new machine using OneDrive, Slack, or another secure method

   - You can export the configuration by right-clicking on the Tunnelblick icon in the menu bar, selecting "VPN Details", then selecting your Crime VPN configuration and clicking "Export Configuration".

      (Please note when you export, it take some time to generate the file and it will be saved in your Desktop folder by default)

3. **Request Temporary Admin Access**
   - You will need to raise a temporary admin request to setup the VPN on your new MacBook
   - Follow the [Temporary Admin Escalation Process](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/spaces/DATS/pages/1824151238/1.+Temporary+Admin+Escalation+Process) for detailed instructions


4. **Import the VPN configuration on your new MacBook**
   - Open Tunnelblick and import the `.tblkSetup` file when you have the Admin rights
   - Verify the connection works before proceeding

## Step 9: Verify Setup

Verify your new MacBook is properly configured:

- Open F5 VPN from [https://portal.platform.hmcts.net/](https://portal.platform.hmcts.net/) and confirm it connects correctly
- If you have Crime access, verify Crime VPN connectivity
  - Connect to Tunnelblick nonlive VPN
  - Check Gerrit is accessible - https://codereview.mdv.cpp.nonlive/
