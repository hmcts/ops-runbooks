# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Conditional Access policy management is now automated via code, improving reviewability, traceability, and reducing manual effort.

---

### Key Points

- **IaC Approach:** All policies managed using Terraform and the AzureAD provider.
- **Repository:** [hmcts/conditional-access-policies-terraform](https://github.com/hmcts/conditional-access-policies-terraform)
- **Code Review:** GAs set as CODEOWNERS for PR approvals.
- **Import:** Existing policies imported to Terraform state.
- **API Limitations:** Deployment parallelism set to 1 request/sec to avoid throttling.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Repository Setup

- Repo: `hmcts/conditional-access-policies-terraform`
- Includes: README, contributing guide, and CODEOWNERS listing GAs.

#### 2. Pipeline and Pre-checks

- Azure DevOps pipeline uses a pre-built Terraform pre-check template:
  - `steps/terraform-precheck.yaml@cnp-azuredevops-libraries`
- Runs linting, validation, and formatting before plan/apply.

#### 3. Service Connection and Permissions

- Azure Service Connection in DevOps using Service Principal: `GA-Prod-Tenant`
- API permissions granted:
  - `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess`
  - `Policy.Read.All`
  - `Group.ReadWrite.All`
  - `User.Read.All`
  - `Application.Read.All`
- Admin consent provided for all permissions.

#### 4. Terraform Configuration

Each policy is defined using the `azuread_conditional_access_policy` resource.

**Example:**

```hcl
resource "azuread_conditional_access_policy" "example_policy" {
  display_name = "Example Conditional Access Policy"
  state        = "enabled"
  conditions {
    client_app_types = [
      "browser",
      "mobileAppsAndDesktopClients",
      "easSupported",
      "other"
    ]
    applications { included_applications = ["All"] }
    locations    { included_locations = ["All"] }
    platforms    { included_platforms = ["all"] }
    users        { included_users = ["All"] }
  }
  grant_controls {
    operator          = "OR"
    built_in_controls = ["block"]
  }
}
```

#### 5. Importing Existing Policies

- Import with:
  ```sh
  terraform import azuread_conditional_access_policy.existing_policy <policy_id>
  ```
- Policy IDs retrieved via Azure CLI.
