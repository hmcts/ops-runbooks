Artifactory is utilized in the context of managing and updating software dependencies and configurations within a Kubernetes environment. Here's how it is used based on the provided instructions:

The steps below will show you how to check the current version of Artifactory being used (7.71.5) and then to update it to a newer version (7.77.3). This process involves accessing Artifactory's website to determine the latest version available.

Before applying the update, a testing process is initiated. This involves downloading a repository containing configuration files for Artifactory (artifactory-sbox.yaml). This file is created and modified to reflect the desired changes, such as updating the version number.

Kubernetes configuration files (kustomization.yaml) are updated to include the changes made in the testing phase. This ensures that the updated configuration is applied correctly within the Kubernetes cluster.

Changes made to the configuration files are submitted for review through a pull request (PR) process. Once approved, the changes are merged into the main branch, allowing them to be deployed.

If any issues arise during the update process, troubleshooting steps are provided. These steps involve identifying and resolving any errors or conflicts that may occur, such as missing namespaces or configuration discrepancies.

• Raise a PR and push changes out for review and approval

10. Troubleshooting:

• If errors occur, troubleshoot as follows:
