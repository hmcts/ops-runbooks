# <%= current_page.data.title %>

These pages are written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language, and stored in a GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of using markdown to create documents - see [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) / [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- Access to the repo [hmcts/ops-runbooks](https://github.com/hmcts/ops-runbooks)

## Documentation Process

1. Initially create documents in a feature-rich editor (e.g., OneNote, Word, [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)) to capture information
2. Once the document is ready, save each page as a file with the extension ``.html.md.erb`` in the appropriate folder

## Index Page Structure
The first page in every folder should be named `index.html.md.erb` and start with these 7 lines of code (do amend title:):

    # <%%= current_page.data.title %>
    
The weight parameter controls the pages position in the master index, with lower numbers appearing at the top. Increment the **count by 10** where possible


## Best Practices for Well-Written Pages

**Structure**

- Include a Prerequisites section at the top
- Use diagrams to illustrate effectively (A good diagram, tells the story)
- Provide information on Admin Tools:
    - Admin portal (URL or IP address)
    - Instructions for downloading, installing, and configuring
    - Describe with text, how to navigate within the system

**Style Guide**

- Follow the house style guide and check out [guide examples](guide-examples/index.html) to assist you in creating your own guides
- Use an empty template for new products and applications
- When section is empty, leave it in place but add the word blank to show it is not relevant 

**Core Sections**

1. Introduction or Description (What is it)
2. Prerequisites (Can the reader make it work)
3. Facts (Links, URLs, IP addresses, or pointers)
