# Adding Pages

These pages are written in the Markdown, lightweight markup language and stored with a github repo.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of using markdown to create documents
- Access to the repo [hmcts/ops-runbooks](https://github.com/hmcts/ops-runbooks)

## Documentation

Initially, documents should be created in OneNote, Word, or other feature rich editor, to enable the information to be captured.  Once the document is ready, save each page as a file within the folder using the extension .html.md.erb
